August 22nd in Marion County Criminal Court.</p><p>He also had his motion to be removed from GPS monitoring granted on July 27th.</p><p>Ron's mistress' husband is accused of blasting nine shots into his rental car on December 11th of 2022, according to criminal court documents.</p><p>The comedian told <a href=#>police</a> at the time that after his performance in Portland, <a href=#>Indiana</a>, a rural town about 94 miles north of Indianapolis, he contacted the woman, identified only as Mrs. Berkemeier, and asked to meet her at a local bar in Indianapolis.</p><h2

people," according to <a href=#>court</a> records.</p><p>After meeting at the Northside Bar and Grill for half an hour, the pair went their separate ways in different vehicles, he told police.</p><p>Ron, who was staying at a nearby hotel and was in town for the show, told police that when he drove to the parking garage, he noticed a sedan traveling closely behind him.</p><p>The comedian said the vehicle pulled up on his left and opened fire.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><img

Berkemeier's husband, Paul, whom he had seen on several occasions before.</p><p>His&nbsp;rental Buick was struck at least nine times, with the rear window shot out, according to a police report.</p><p>The Bob and Tom Show comedian suffered injuries to his ear and cheek consistent with shattered glass being blown on his face, records show.</p><p>In October 2021, Ron also filed a police report against Paul after he attacked him and threatened him and his family, according to NBC affiliate <a href=#>WTHR</a>.</p><p>Mrs. Berkemeier corroborated Sexton's story, telling police her husband became angry when he found out she left their home near Shelbyville to meet up with Sexton, court docs from the 2022 incident showed.&nbsp;</p><h2>SHOCKING DEATH</h2><p>Ron was <a href=#>found dead in his Ohio hotel</a> room on July 21st before a scheduled performance of his Donnie Baker stand-up act in Dayton Friday night.</p><p>Local police said Ron was found dead at a Holiday Inn Express on Friday afternoon around 2:20pm, an hour away from his gig later that night.</p><p>The <a href=#>comedian's wife, Tracey</a>, is listed as his next of kin in the police report, <a href=#>while his alleged </a>mistress, whose been publicly named as Mrs. Berkemeier, is listed as an OIV, police shorthand for offender/involved/victim.</p><p>Police were called when Holiday Inn Express staffers found
