He is making his debut in Netflix’s ‘Cheer’ season 2 and earning recognition on his right who was previously known as Angel Rice’s brother. This article discusses his girlfriend, height, and his age.</p><p>Delve into this Jaden “Jaymo” Rice article to learn more about him.</p><h3><strong>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice On Netlix’s Cheer Season 2</strong></h3><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice is a member of the rival team Trinity Valley Community College who is ready to challenge their rival team and last year’s champion Navarro College. Jaymo tumbles alongside his star sister Angel Rice at TVCC. He has grown close with Johnson and Ben his two teammates.</p><p>He is appearing alongside his co-stars <a href=#>Jada Wooten</a>, a second-year tumbler and flyer, Jeron Hazelwood, TVCC’s star stunter and tumbler, Devonte ‘Dee’ Joseph, one of TVCC’s new tumblers who can successfully pull off a “quint” that is so difficult it’s illegal to perform at Daytona, <a href=#>Angel Rice</a>, a Guinness Book of World Records holder for most double full twists and a former member of Team USA gymnastics, and Ben “Benji” Chester who is known for his flexibility. With all the star cheer, TVCC’s team looked formidable team this year.</p><p>Jaden announced the premiere of Netflix’s show on his IG. He shared his excitement for the world to get to know his team that captioned the post, “<a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#CheerSeason2</a>&nbsp;premiers January 12 on&nbsp;<a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@netflix</a>. Excited for the world to get to know&nbsp;<a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@trinityvalleycheer</a>“.</p><h3><strong>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice doesn’t seem to be dating anyone as of this moment. Most of his social media posts are of him practicing his craft so there is not much that we know about his girlfriend. Jaden could be dating someone and is in a relationship but unlike his other team members, he avoids flaunting his relationship on social media platforms.</p><p>Hence, his private nature made it quite impossible to answer the question of whether he is single or in a relationship. But, the fact that Jaden is absolutely lowkey on that part of his life, we believe that he is single until he proclaims his dating life to the world.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Jaden “Jaymo” Rice?</strong></h3><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice turned 19 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice Height</strong></h3><p>Talking about his height, Jaden “Jaymo” stands tall under 6 feet.</p><h3><strong>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice Career</strong></h3><p>Jaden had previously cheered for the Stingray Allstars. In May 2018, he had announced making it on the Stingray All-Stars team with an IG post, “Your boy just made Steel again <a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#steelrays</a><a class=xil3i tabindex=0 href=#>#imaderays</a>“.</p><p>Back in 2016, Jaden had won the Spirit of Hope Cheer competition organized at Charlotte Convention Center. Whereas, Stingrays had secured third place in the World in 2018. He captioned, “3rd place in the World not so bad for my 1st year”.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Jaden “Jaymo” Rice Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice celebrates his birthday on 14 August every year.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Who Are Jaden “Jaymo” Rice’s Parents And Siblings?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jaden “Jaymo” Rice was born to his father Bennie R Rice and his mother Tonyona Ebony Olriedge.</p><p>His father attended Druid Hills High School and is also available on Facebook (@bennie.r.rice). But, the last time his father posted on the platform is to wish his wife Tonyona happy birthday which was on 29 August 2015.</p><p>As for Jaden’s mother, she is affiliated with an online store under the name Tee’s Sweet & Crafty Closet. She has promoted the online shop on her Facebook. Tonyona is also on Instagram (@tonya_thementalblockcoach) and her IG bio read, “Private Tumbling Coach/The Stingray Allstars Johnscreek/Party Decorator and Crafter/ General Mills <a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@teescrafty_closet</a>“.</p><p>The Rice family currently resides in their hometown of Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>About his siblings, Angel is a three-time world Cheerleading Champion. In 2015, she won with Stingrays Orange Small Senior, then she won with California All-Stars Smoed Small Senior in 2015, and Rockstar Cheer Beatles in 2019. She is a world-renowned power tumbler who also competed for USA Gymnastics Power Tumbling National Team at Power Tumbling Worlds in 2014 and 2015. She ranked 9th in the world in 2015 in the rod floor tumbling event.</p><p>A Tampa, Florida-based Sophia Piloto wrote on ‘My Hero’ site that she cited Angel as her hero. She revealed that Angel had made the decision not to cheer in 2017 but when Jaden made the world champion’s team, she changed her decision to cheer with him because it was something her brother wanted to do with her.</p><p>More on that, her decision to leave the competitive cheerleading world was heavily swayed by her brother Jaden who had tried out for Stingrays for the first time and was placed on Steel.</p><p>Besides Angel, Jaden also has another sister named De’kiera “Kee Kee” Olriedge. Her IG account is (@dekiera) and her Facebook is (@dekiera). De’keira attended Chamblee Charter High School followed by <span class=nc684nl6>Paul Mitchell Schools</span>.
