When asked during an interview with E! News about how she's enjoying her single life, she replied, "I think it's fun." She also advised young women to, "Focus on your work and your passion.

According to The Cut, in June 2020, a Twitter user who claimed to be a fan of Elgort accused him of assaulting her in 2014. She said that after meeting on Snapchat, Elgort (who was 20 at the time) and the anonymous accuser (who was 17) exchanged messages which led to a personal encounter, where Elgort coerced her intimacy. Elgort has denied the allegations, but the damage seems to have already been done to their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dq7awuMStq5plm6S6ur%2FHmqVmpZGZsm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-violetta-komyshan-made-net-worth.html&text=How%20Ansel%20Elgort%27s%20Ex%20Violetta%20Komyshan%20Really%20Made%20Her%20Mysterious%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-violetta-komyshan-made-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-violetta-komyshan-made-net-worth.html&title=How%20Ansel%20Elgort%27s%20Ex%20Violetta%20Komyshan%20Really%20Made%20Her%20Mysterious%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-violetta-komyshan-made-net-worth.html&title=How%20Ansel%20Elgort%27s%20Ex%20Violetta%20Komyshan%20Really%20Made%20Her%20Mysterious%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-violetta-komyshan-made-net-worth.html&title=How%20Ansel%20Elgort%27s%20Ex%20Violetta%20Komyshan%20Really%20Made%20Her%20Mysterious%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-violetta-komyshan-made-net-worth.html&description=How%20Ansel%20Elgort%27s%20Ex%20Violetta%20Komyshan%20Really%20Made%20Her%20Mysterious%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-james-ferentz-related-to-kirk-ferentz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is James Ferentz related to Kirk Ferentz?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./firefighter-dominic-rubino-visitation-funeral-arrangement.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Firefighter Dominic Rubino Visitation, Funeral Arrangement">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
