She has a natural talent for putting together stunning clothes and staying current with fashion trends. <strong>Eric Williams</strong> appeared to be doing well until Jennifer filed for divorce three years later. Fortunately, they were able to part ways in a nice and quiet manner.</p><p>She was excited to start a fresh chapter in her life after her divorce. Jennifer Williams, the ex-wife of former NBA star Eric Williams, is one of the Basketball Wives' most amusing characters. People want to know if she is currently dating someone in 2022. So follow this article to know about her boyfriend.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>relationship</a></strong> details of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Austin Stowell</strong></a>.</p><h2 class=label-text dir=ltr>Basketball Wives: Who Is Jennifer Williams’ Boyfriend in 2022? Fans Believe the Basketball Wives Star Is Dating Her New Partner, Jelani Asar Snipes; Who Is Her Ex-Husband?</h2><p>Things romantically evolved swiftly in season 10 of the VH1 reality TV show, with <strong>Jennifer Williams</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@jenniferwilliams</a>) and <strong>Jelani Asar Snipes</strong> rapidly hitting it off and even exchanging a cheeky kiss on their second date.</p><p>Since then, fans have been crossing their fingers that the couple will eventually make things official. While her personal life has come under intense scrutiny following her involvement in some turmoil involving her divorce & ex-boyfriend <strong>Tim Norman.</strong></p><p>Neither of them has shared any images on social media to establish their relationship status. Despite this, it's evident that people are rooting for them and looking for any indications that they're together. As seen on Basketball Wives, Jennifer and Jelani have been on multiple dates.</p><p>Jennifer Williams has stated that she wishes to take her time with him. Moreover, Jennifer believes that there is something exceptional about Jelani and that he is fulfilling all of the prayers she asked God to send her. Likewise, Jelani stated that he enjoys spending time with Jennifer. He is open to children and marriage because he is at an age when he can support a family. He has informed his mother about her.</p><p>Jelani Asar Spines (born in 1988) is the son of <strong>Wesley Snipes</strong> and <strong>April Dubois</strong>. He has done some acting himself, appearing in 1990's Mo' Better Blues as the character Miles at the age of one. Furthermore, he was reared alongside his brother <strong>Akhenaten</strong> and sister <strong>Iset,</strong> and he has lately been starring on the VH1 reality <a href=# rel=noopener>TV show</a>, where he has been purportedly seeing Jennifer Williams after the two ignited dating rumors on the show.</p><p>Jelani is very close to his mother, as evidenced by him telling Jennifer that he is not scared by powerful women because he was raised by a hero, referring to his mother.</p><p>Meanwhile, the duo has gotten a lot of attention recently, as admirers have used social media to ship the couple. But neither Jennifer nor Jelani have not verified their relationship, and no photos have been uploaded to her social media account. While Jelani isn't active on social media, people are rooting for the couple.</p><h2>Details on Jennifer Williams’ Relationship Timeline & Her Ex-boyfriend Pleads Guilty to His Nephew’s Murder!</h2><p><strong>Jennifer Williams</strong> is a Basketball Wives cast member since she was <a href=# rel=noopener>formerly married</a> to professional basketball star <strong>Eric Williams </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@ewjr50</a>)&nbsp;They initially met in 2000, when she was working her way up in the real estate industry.</p><p>The real estate sector is notorious for being difficult, with many highs and lows, but she was dominant in her area at the time. She and Eric married in 2007 and appeared to be doing well until she filed for divorce three years later.</p><p>Fortunately, they were able to part ways amicably.Jennifer Williams left the marriage with half of their joint property and was prepared to move on with her life. On the other hand, she was romantically linked to an actor named <strong>Cisco Risado</strong> in 2014. Their relationship, however, was brief.</p><p><strong>Tim Norman,</strong> the star of Sweetie Pies, has been her most visible relationship after her divorce. Although she undoubtedly felt he was her perfect match at the time, she was absolutely incorrect. Jennifer and Norman dated for a little over a year until she accused him of stalking and harassing her in 2017, according to Atlanta Black Star. The following year, she went to court and asked for a permanent restraining order against him.</p><p>If he comes within 150 feet of Jennifer Williams and violates the present restraining order, he will risk jail time. Jennifer discussed barring him from her phone and social media pages once they were through in order to find serenity.</p><p>Fortunately, it doesn't appear that he'll be approaching her anytime soon. He pleaded guilty in June 2022 to his role in the 2016 murder of his nephew,<strong> Andre Montgomery Jr.,</strong> and now faces life in prison.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoywoKWkmZa6tHnBmqqknaSXrq24jLCgr52jYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGJ%2FcX6RaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-williams-basketball-wives-boyfriend-2022.html&text=Jennifer%20Williams%20Boyfriend%20In%202%20The%20Basketball%20Wives%20Cast%20Is%20Currently%20Dating%20Wesley%20Snipes%20S&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-williams-basketball-wives-boyfriend-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-williams-basketball-wives-boyfriend-2022.html&title=Jennifer%20Williams%20Boyfriend%20In%202%20The%20Basketball%20Wives%20Cast%20Is%20Currently%20Dating%20Wesley%20Snipes%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjennifer-williams-basketball-wives-boyfriend-2022.html&title=Jennifer%20Williams%20Boyfriend%20In%202%20The%20Basketball%20Wives%20Cast%20Is%20Currently%20Dating%20Wesley%20Snipes%20S" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-williams-basketball-wives-boyfriend-2022.html&title=Jennifer%20Williams%20Boyfriend%20In%202%20The%20Basketball%20Wives%20Cast%20Is%20Currently%20Dating%20Wesley%20Snipes%20S" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-williams-basketball-wives-boyfriend-2022.html&description=Jennifer%20Williams%20Boyfriend%20In%202%20The%20Basketball%20Wives%20Cast%20Is%20Currently%20Dating%20Wesley%20Snipes%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kid-rock.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kid Rock - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./carmen-munroe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carmen Munroe">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
