As a freshman at the University of Connecticut, she took the college basketball world by storm, leading her team to the Final Four while earning numerous accolades and awards along the way. Many fans and analysts alike expected her to make the leap to the WNBA after her freshman season, but to the surprise of many, she decided to stay in <a href=#>college</a> for another year. This decision left many wondering: why didn't Paige Bueckers go to the WNBA?</p><p>There are a few different factors that likely played into Bueckers' decision to stay in college. For one, she is still relatively young and has plenty of time to develop her game further before making the jump to the professional level. Additionally, she likely enjoys the college lifestyle and the camaraderie that comes with being part of a team. But perhaps most importantly, Bueckers likely sees the benefit in continuing to play under the tutelage of UConn head coach Geno Auriemma.</p><p>Auriemma is widely regarded as one of the best coaches in <a href=#>college basketball</a> history, and he has a proven track record of developing players who go on to succeed at the professional level. Bueckers is already an incredibly talented player, but there is no doubt that she has room to grow and improve, especially when it comes to certain aspects of her game like defense and strength training. By staying in <a href=#>college</a> and continuing to work with Auriemma, she can continue to develop her skills and refine her game in a way that will make her an even better player when she eventually does make the jump to the WNBA.</p><p>Of course, there are certainly some downsides to staying in college for another year. For one, Bueckers will be foregoing a year of WNBA salary and experience, which could hurt her in the long run. Additionally, there is always the risk of injury, and if Bueckers were to suffer a serious injury during her sophomore season, it could greatly impact her future <a href=#>prospects</a> in the WNBA.</p><p>Despite these risks, however, Bueckers' decision to stay in college is ultimately a smart one. She has already proven that she is one of the best players in college basketball, and by continuing to develop her skills and work with Auriemma, she will only get better. When she eventually does make the leap to the WNBA, she will be a force to be reckoned with, and she will likely have a long and successful career in the league.</p><p>In the meantime, fans of <a href=#>women's basketbal</a>l can continue to enjoy watching Bueckers dominate on the college level. She is a once-in-a-generation talent who is sure to leave an indelible mark on the sport, and her decision to stay in college for another year only adds to the excitement and anticipation surrounding her future. Ultimately, only time will tell what Bueckers' legacy will be, but if her freshman season was any indication, she is destined for greatness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7JllJ6xr3nTZqeaoZeaeqPBxJyinqqjYrSwedOoZLCmkpY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-didn-t-paige-bueckers-go-to-wnba.html&text=Why%20didnt%20Paige%20Bueckers%20go%20to%20WNBA%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-didn-t-paige-bueckers-go-to-wnba.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-didn-t-paige-bueckers-go-to-wnba.html&title=Why%20didnt%20Paige%20Bueckers%20go%20to%20WNBA%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-didn-t-paige-bueckers-go-to-wnba.html&title=Why%20didnt%20Paige%20Bueckers%20go%20to%20WNBA%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-didn-t-paige-bueckers-go-to-wnba.html&title=Why%20didnt%20Paige%20Bueckers%20go%20to%20WNBA%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-didn-t-paige-bueckers-go-to-wnba.html&description=Why%20didnt%20Paige%20Bueckers%20go%20to%20WNBA%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1261-madison-avenue.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="1261 Madison Avenue, Apt. 4N, Sales Price, Co-op, Carnegie Hill, NYC">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-untold-truth-of-daniel-toshs-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Untold Truth Of Daniel Tosh's Wife">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
