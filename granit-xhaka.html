It was a big claim as Shaqiri was considered as the finest talent to have emerged from Switzerland in decades. However, Xhaka has shown flashes of immense talent since having made his debut for Basel. His ability to strike cleanly from the distance has made him a fan favorite at all the clubs he had played for. His passing range is also great but his indiscipline and inconsistency have stopped him from becoming the player that everyone who is close to him had hoped for.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Granit Xhaka</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Granit</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Granit-Xhaka-during-a-game-in-August-2018.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Libra</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Basel, Switzerland</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=Swiss src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Switzerland.png alt=Swiss width=64 height=44 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3></h3><h3>Education</h3><p>Granit Xhaka started his soccer journey at the youth setup of&nbsp;<strong>Concordia Basel</strong>.

He played 19 matches in the league campaign.</li><li>In his 2nd season with Basel, he played 23 matches in the league. He also managed to win a Domestic double with his club winning&nbsp;the&nbsp;League&nbsp;Championship title and the&nbsp;Swiss Cup.</li><li>In May 2012, the Swiss club announced that they had reached a transfer deal with&nbsp;Borussia Mönchengladbach. The transfer deal was reported to be worth&nbsp;€8.5&nbsp;million.</li><li>In September 2012, he scored his first goal for&nbsp;Borussia Mönchengladbach in a 2-3 home loss against&nbsp;1. FC Nürnberg. It was his only goal of the season.</li><li>Arsenal announced in May 2016 that they had reached an agreement to sign Xhaka from&nbsp;Borussia Mönchengladbach. The transfer fee&nbsp;was reported to be in the region of&nbsp;£30–35&nbsp;million.</li><li>He scored his first goal for the English side in September 2016 as he scored a 25-yard screamer in a match against Hull City. His side emerged as a winner with a 4-1 scoreline.</li><li>Just 4 days after having scored his debut goal, he scored another stunning long-range goal.

He even starred in the final against Chelsea, which his side won by 2-1.</li><li>Before he decided on his international allegiance, he was torn between representing his birth country, Switzerland and his ancestral country, Albania. He eventually went for the former as they had shown more interest in him while the Albanian federation was ignoring him.</li><li>He scored his first international goal in a match against&nbsp;Luxembourg, which was his 6th international match. It was the only goal scored in the match.</li><li>During the UEFA Euro 16, he became a part of the history as he lined up against his brother, Taulant Xhaka, in Switzerland’s match against Albania. His mother was in attendance at the match and decided to wear a T-shirt that featured the flags of both the countries.</li><li>He courted controversy during Switzerland’s match against Serbia in the group stage of FIFA World Cup 2018. He and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Xherdan Shaqiri</a> decided to celebrate their goals by making an eagle gesture, which was a nod&nbsp;to the double-headed eagle on the Albanian flag.</li><li>He was slapped with a fine of 10,000&nbsp;Swiss francs by FIFA for making a political gesture during a match. Albania and Serbia have been embroiled in long dispute and Xhaka’s gesture was seen as an insult to the Serbian public.</li><li>Follow Granit Xhaka on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;Granit Xhaka / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqCpmqaZqXq5tMCkmGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgranit-xhaka.html&text=Granit%20Xhaka%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgranit-xhaka.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgranit-xhaka.html&title=Granit%20Xhaka%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgranit-xhaka.html&title=Granit%20Xhaka%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgranit-xhaka.html&title=Granit%20Xhaka%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgranit-xhaka.html&description=Granit%20Xhaka%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kapil-sharma-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-636190-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kapil Sharma Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./courtney-k-randolph-bio-boyfriend-parents-too-hot-to-handle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Courtney K Randolph Bio, Boyfriend, Parents, Too Hot to Handle">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
