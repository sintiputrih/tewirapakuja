If you’ve ever wondered where Trisha Yearwood lives, you’ll be relieved to learn that she continues to reside with Garth Brooks.</p><p>That’s right; the couple is still going strong as a family, living their best life, and firmly entrenched in my view as one of country music’s most adorable long-term couples.</p><h4>Garth Brooks House Nashville (Current)</h4><p>Brooks and his wife Trisha make their home in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, just outside of Nashville. They’ve owned the house since November 1990, when they paid $432,500 for it.</p><p>The guarded entrance to the 5,551 square foot home, which was completed in 1970, includes 13 rooms in total, including 7 bedrooms and 6 baths. It has a pool, a 1,575-square-foot garage, and a 746-square-foot basement and is situated on a 19.8-acre property.</p><h4>Garth Brooks House Malibu (Former)</h4><p>Brooks and his wife also owned a $7 million property in Paradise Cove, Malibu, which they sold in 2016 to internet entrepreneur Adam Bernhard.</p><p>In detail, the ranch-style home, which was completed in 1958 and situated on a half-acre of land within a gated community, was initially built in 1958.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/garth-brooks-malibu-house-1024x683.jpg><p>The interior of Garth Brooks’ home was restored and featured French doors, vaulted and beamed ceilings, skylights, glass walls, and clerestory windows.</p><p>Also, a den doubled as a library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and a white brick fireplace, and a living room with a corner fireplace.</p><h4>Garth Brooks Oklahoma House (Current)</h4><p>Before moving to the Nashville area in 2014, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood bought a property in Oklahoma.</p><p>Brooks’ ex-wife and his daughters lived there, and he wanted to be close to them. Thus, the couple chose this location.</p><p>Trisha was unsure about managing their professions so far away from Nashville at the time, so Brooks promised that they would relocate once all of the girls graduated high school.</p><p>The $3.5 million, 14,089-square-foot French country-style home in Owasso, Oklahoma, sits on 2.4 acres of land. There are 7 bedrooms, 9.5 bathrooms, 2 kitchens, a screening room, a gym, and a 5-car garage in this mansion.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Brooks has been seen driving around in a white Mercedes, but he also reports that he owns a red Corvette and a white Mustang.</p><p>But,&nbsp; his favorite item is a red Chevrolet K series pickup truck from 1993. According to his wife, Trisha Yearwood, Brooks loves his truck so much that he drove it “all over hell and gone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/garth-with-his-car-1024x576.jpg><p>So, she chose to rebuild the automobile as a birthday present to Brooks, unaware that he had already offered it up for auction for the ACM Lifting Lives Gala that the two were presenting.</p><p>Brooks had to have the refurbished truck back when he saw it. So, after it went up to a stunning $285,000., he bought it from the auction as the highest bidder.</p><p><strong>You might also be interested in <a href=# rel=noopener>Aidan Gillen’s Net Worth: Career & Audio Books.</a></strong></p><h2>Garth Brooks: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Brooks, on the other hand, does not appear to enjoy a luxury lifestyle. He’s presently doing a long run of shows in Las Vegas, and he told Leach that he feels the show’s casual tone works well.</p><p>“You’re flying by the seat of your pants,” he actually said. Finally, having a large ass works in your favor.” “I’ve got to tell you; it really hones your guitar playing, your communication with the crowd, your own vocals,”</p><p>Brooks said of the shows with just Garth and a guitar. “Because it’s just you and a guitar up there, it’s always a final exam. It’s excellent for me since you have nowhere to hide.”</p><p>There is a glimmer of light near the end of the story when the discussion turns to become an empty nester after his youngest daughter graduates from high school in 2014 and if Brooks will record any more records.</p><p>He says, “There’s always a need to create because I believe that’s what I do.” As a result, I’ll take that as a yes.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>Due to a busy schedule, Brooks hardly takes any vacation. However, his shooting and touring for different music videos and advertisements allow him to travel worldwide.</p><h2>Music, Touring, Endorsements, Commercials and Book Publications</h2><h3>Music</h3><p>Brooks began his career in music while attending Oklahoma State University, singing in pubs and clubs. He relocated to Nashville in 1987.</p><p>Eventually, Brooks signed with Capitol Records with the help of music manager Bob Doyle. “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>The Dance</strong></a>” and “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>If Tomorrow Never Comes</strong></a>” were two of his early hits.</p><p>His debut album, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Hungry Years</strong></a>, debuted at number two on the Billboard top country albums chart and number thirteen on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>The record’s song “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>The Dance</strong></a>,” which also happens to be his favorite, reached number one. His second album was even more well-received by his fans.</p><p>No Fences topped the Billboard Top Country Albums Chart for 23 weeks and ranked third on the Billboard 200. With sales topping 16 million copies, this album became his most successful.</p><h3>Touring</h3><p>Brooks’ tours are also among the most profitable. Their World Tour (2014-17) grossed over $364.0 million, while his solo tour (1996-98) grossed over $105.0 million, indicating that he earned almost $1.0 million per concert.</p><p>He was reportedly said to have been paid $100,000 for a 2015 event in Chicago.
