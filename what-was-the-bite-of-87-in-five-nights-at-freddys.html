In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IGM interview</a>, FNAF creator Scott Cawthon stated that the idea for&nbsp;the horror franchise stemmed from a resoundingly negative reaction to his previous game, the family-friendly&nbsp;Chipper & Sons Lumber Co., where players claimed that the main character Tyke (a beaver’s son) resembled “a scary animatronic animal,” and reviewer&nbsp;Jim Sterling&nbsp;called the game “unintentionally terrifying.” From a fateful slip-up with Cawthon’s questionable character models, FNAF was born.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Five Nights at Freddy’s follows a security guard who takes the night shift at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza (think Chuck E. Cheese), a family-friendly pizzeria named after its mascot, Freddy Fazbear. Assuming the role of the night-time employee, players must survive each night with limited power, all while keeping the sentient and hostile animatronics that roam the restaurant at bay.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>An explanation for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s lore</a> eventually reveals itself through voice recordings, minigames, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter eggs</a>. But there’s one significant incident that isn’t too clear — the infamous Bite of ’87.</p><h2 id=h-the-bite-of-87-explained data-injectable=false>The Bite of 87 Explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Five-Nights-at-Freddys-2.jpg><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true>As the name suggests, the Bite of ’87 was an incident that occurred in 1987 at the second Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza and it was briefly mentioned by Phone Guy, a former Freddy Fazbear’s employee who aids the protagonists with ominous tips and forewarnings. There’s plenty of speculation, but the identities of both the victim and the animatronic involved are unknown, but the Bite of ’87 supposedly resulted in the victim losing their frontal lobe and miraculously surviving.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>The newsworthy incident attributed to the company’s reputation downfall, resulting in a major drop in business at the chain restaurant’s many locations.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>In a last-ditch effort to prevent the Bite of ’87 from repeating itself, management made it so that the animatronics were no longer allowed to wander around the building during the day, and their free-roaming mode was limited to nighttime. This decision is quite possibly the driving force behind the game’s overall premise.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>A similar incident would be the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bite of ’83</a>, wherein a young child is bullied by older kids into “giving Freddy Fazbear a kiss.” This results in him being pushed into Freddy’s gaping jaw, only for the animatronic to clamp down on his head, crushing it.</p><h2 id=h-bite-of-87-theories data-injectable=false>Bite of ’87 Theories</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FNAF-Nightmare-Foxy.jpg><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>With how horrific and significant the Bite of ’87 plotline is, it’s no surprise that many have been left wondering which character is responsible for it. There has been no official confirmation as to who it was, perhaps to continue the conversation and generate continued interest in the franchise as fans hope to learn the truth one day. In the meantime, fans have taken it upon themselves to generate a number of well-constructed theories as to who could be the culprit.</p><h3 id=h-foxy data-injectable=false>Foxy</h3><p data-characters=586 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>FNAF fans have long speculated that Foxy is the animatronic responsible for the Bite of ’87, given his sharp and serrated teeth. In Foxy’s domain, known as Pirate Cove, there’s a sign that reads “Sorry! Out of Order,” implying that Foxy fell into disrepair following the incident and was put out of commission. Foxy’s jaw also hangs loosely, suggesting that considerable force might have disjointed it. However, Foxy is cleared of suspicion in the second game, when it’s proven that he was most likely getting repairs when the bite took place.</p><h3 id=h-freddy data-injectable=false>Freddy</h3><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Some other fans speculate that Freddy Fazbear himself was responsible; on the ‘Rules’ board located in the&nbsp;East Hall&nbsp;in the original game, one of the rules listed states, “Don’t touch Freddy<strong>.</strong>” It’s possible that this rule may have been enacted after the Bite of ’87. There’s also some analysis of Freddy’s face that highlights handprints, suggesting that someone may have struggled against him at some point. This was disproven in Five Nights at Freddy’s 2, however, when Freddy is seen wearing a different, print-less mask.</p><h3 id=h-mangle data-injectable=false>Mangle</h3><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Finally, some players believe that Mangle was responsible for the Bite of ’87. This theory seems the most plausible, since Mangle’s jumpscare animation sees it swinging down from above, jaws open wide, and biting the player in the head — right around where the frontal lobe would be located. The lore also states that Mangle was designed to be dismantled repeatedly as a “take apart and put back together” attraction for children, so there’s a motive for Mangle to be vengeful against youngsters specifically.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>There’s many more stories behind the Bite of ’87, but no one knows the truth. In fact, it’s never confirmed whether the victim is a child or not, so it could very well be an adult. We’ll keep theorizing regardless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZorqGZpGLEor%2BMrZ%2BeZZKewaZ5zp9kcW9dnrtussivnGammZy1tb%2BMmqtmnqKasaXF0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-the-bite-of-87-in-five-nights-at-freddys.html&text=What%20was%20the%20Bite%20of%2087%20in%20Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddys%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-the-bite-of-87-in-five-nights-at-freddys.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-the-bite-of-87-in-five-nights-at-freddys.html&title=What%20was%20the%20Bite%20of%2087%20in%20Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddys%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-was-the-bite-of-87-in-five-nights-at-freddys.html&title=What%20was%20the%20Bite%20of%2087%20in%20Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddys%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-the-bite-of-87-in-five-nights-at-freddys.html&title=What%20was%20the%20Bite%20of%2087%20in%20Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddys%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-the-bite-of-87-in-five-nights-at-freddys.html&description=What%20was%20the%20Bite%20of%2087%20in%20Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddys%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./anna-melomud.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anna Melomud">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wanda-smith-upset-boss-didnt-commercial-katt-williams-roasted-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wanda Smith Was Upset That Her Boss Didnt Go to Commercial When Katt Williams Roasted Her">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
