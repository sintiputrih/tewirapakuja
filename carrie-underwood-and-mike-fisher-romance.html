If you are one of those individuals that want to learn more about their relationship, then you’ve come to the right place. Below is your ultimate guide for the Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>First Meeting and First Impressions</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)</a></p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href=#>10 Fascinating Facts About Country Singer Carrie Underwood</a></p><p>Underwood and Fisher first met in 2008 at a backstage meet-and-greet at one of Underwood’s concerts. Mark Childers, who is Underwood’s bassist, set the meeting up.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Underwood almost declined the meeting, she did push through with it, and it was a success. As far as first impressions go, the singer recalled thinking that Mike was hot.&nbsp;</p><p>She also said during an interview that among the many guys she had dated, Fisher was the one with whom she had an easy time being in a relationship. The singer added that she felt he was the guy destined for her.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did They Handle Their Long Distance Relationship?</h2><p>Even if they had amazing romantic chemistry, Underwood and Fisher couldn’t see each other much. That was because the country singer stayed in Nashville while the NHL star was living in Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in mid-2008, the two started their long-distance dating. Their relationship back then consisted mostly of frequent phone calls. Underwood once jokingly talked about her making dating more challenging by choosing to date someone who lives in another country.&nbsp;</p><p>They did see each other in person three months after they started their LDR. Of course, Underwood and Fisher’s efforts paid off on December 31, 2008. They shared their first kiss as the ball dropped in Times Square.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Fisher wasn’t a “PDA guy,” Underwood decided to take the initiative and made him kiss her in public. She said she went for it, believing he wouldn’t leave her hanging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Couple’s Engagement and Marriage&nbsp;</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Mike Fisher (@mfisher1212)</a></p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#>Meet Carrie Underwood’s Husband Who Is Keeping The Singer Grounded</a></p><p>After almost a year of being in a romantic relationship, Underwood and Fisher decided it was time to level things up. The superstar athlete proposed to the country singer on a cozy afternoon in his home on December 20, 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>Following their engagement, the couple started frequently appearing at high-profile events together. A notable event where the two were together was the CMT Awards in June 2010, where Fisher served as Underwood’s date for the evening.&nbsp;</p><p>During that event, Underwood snagged the Video of the Year Award. Despite his preference to stay away from PDA, Fisher shared a sweet kiss with Underwood before she went on stage to accept her award.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, the couple tied the knot on July 10, 2010, after almost two years of dating. They held the special event at the Ritz-Carlton resort on Lake Oconee, Georgia. The couple shared what some would call a “spiritual expression of love.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Fisher’s Trade to the Nashville Predators Did for the Couple</h2><p>Due to their respective careers, the couple got forced to split their time between Peterborough, Ontario, and Nashville, Tennessee. However, that ended in February 2011 after Fisher got traded to the Nashville Predators. The two reunited and received the perfect opportunity to spend more time together.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the hockey star, in his frustration, he prayed to God a few days before moving teams. He asked Him to take care of everything, which the Almighty did. Fisher believes the Lord put him in a place he’d feel at ease. He also finds comfort in knowing he is where he should be.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Welcoming Their First Child and Parenthood&nbsp;</h2><p>After about five years of marriage, Underwood and Fisher finally welcomed their first child. The happy couple decided to name their son Isaiah.&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah spends plenty of time joining his mother backstage during her shows. He also enjoys doing yoga sessions and, of course, quality time with his dad.&nbsp;</p><p>During an interview with E! News about Fisher’s performance with fatherhood, Underwood says that her husband is a rare find because, apart from being a hot hunk, he is also wonderful at it. She adds that Fisher is a great dad and that he’s also supportive of what she does as his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Underwood says she also returns the favor by giving her husband all the support he needs from his wife. On top of all that, she says that they love their little family.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8th Wedding Anniversary and Second Pregnancy Announcement&nbsp;</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)</a></p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href=#>Mike Fisher Shares Never-Before-Seen Photos Of Carrie Underwood In Honor Of Mother’s Day</a></p><p>On July 10, 2018, Underwood and Fisher turned to social media to share their 8th Wedding Anniversary celebration.

Underwood also expresses her ever-growing love for her husband and her desire to spend more years with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, about a month after their 8th anniversary, Underwood shared the big news about them expecting their second child. She posted a video on her Instagram account revealing that her tour would start in May that year because of her pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, Underwood again goes on Instagram and shares a photo taken from the backstage of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Grand Ole Opry</a>. In it, the singer shows off her baby bump.&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward to January 21, 2019, Underwood and Fisher welcomed their second son, Jacob Bryan Fisher. The country singer shares an Instagram photo gallery of her newborn child along with herself, Fisher, and Isaiah.&nbsp;</p><p>The singer says their hearts were full even if they were tired, and their new child will forever change their lives.
