We watched her become a star on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Disney Channel</a>, with early hits like Sonny with a Chance and Camp Rock -&nbsp;then, we saw her make the transition into music. This would launch her into true superstardom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We literally watched this girl grow up, blossom into a woman, and reach the pinnacle of success. We have seen Lovato evolve through the ups and downs of her career, and because we have seen her grow up before our eyes on big and small screens, we do know a lot about her.</p><p>When it comes to her family, we tend to forget that she has not one, not two, but three sisters. Who are they?</p><h2 id=meet-amber><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Meet Amber</span></h2><p>Amber Lovato (or, as she goes by now, Amber Smith) is the eldest half-sister of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former home school student</a>, Demi Lovato. Amber was&nbsp;born in New Mexico to the same father as Demi - his name is Patrick. We will explain a little bit later on why Demi didn't meet Amber until she turned 20...and why we still know so few things about Amber and her relationship with her famous sis.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Facts That Reveal Who The REAL Demi Lovato Is</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meet-dallas><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Meet Dallas</span></h2><p>Dallas Lovato is an actress, just like Demi is, and she's the second-oldest of the bunch. She was given her charming name because she was born in Dallas, Texas, but that wasn't the only reason she got that name. The other reason is that her mother was a cheerleader for the NFL's Dallas Cowboys during the 1982-83 season. There's another fun fact for you.</p><h2 id=meet-madison><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Meet Madison</span></h2><p>Madison Lovato (better known by her real name, Madison De La Garza) is, among many things, an actress. Later, we will get into the other professions she has dabbled in, beyond her movie and TV work. It's clear that Madison, who is currently 18, has a bright future ahead of her, and lofty ambitions to do big things in life.</p><h2 id=didn-t-meet-amber-until-2013><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Didn't Meet Amber Until 2013</span></h2><p>While being interviewed in 2013, on the New York radio station show, WBIL's Dana and Jeffrey in the Morning, Demi Lovato <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped a bombshell</a>&nbsp;live on the air. She revealed that she had a half-sister that she did not meet until recently. Apparently, Amber feared that she reached out immediately to her richer half-sister, Demi would think she wanted favors or money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the story itself is juicy, Demi decided to divulge nothing further than that, because she believed that at least some parts of her life deserved to remain private.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After Showing PDA In A New Video, Demi Lovato Seems Happily In Love</a></span></p><h2 id=dallas-is-a-tiktok-star><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Dallas Is A TikTok Star</span></h2><p>Don't let the old age fool you. Dallas Lovato (she's 32) is hip with all of the cool social media crazes that the kids are raving about these days. One of them being TikTok, which Dallas actually has posted videos on. She also reposts some of her TikToks on her Instagram page. Followers will see that she often posts funny videos and is even producing and releasing face masks during COVID-19.</p><h2 id=madison-is-a-youtube-star><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Madison Is A YouTube Star</span></h2><p>Those who are wondering what Madison has been up to in her own life journey in more recent years should definitely check out her YouTube channel, which has impressive 39k followers. Granted, she has not been incredibly active recently, but the channel is still filled with everything that Lovato fans want, from personal stories to trailers for movie projects she's worked on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dallas-filmography><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Dallas' Filmography</span></h2><p>While Dallas Lovato has never quite popped off in Hollywood as a star attraction (not yet, anyway - never say never), she does have some interesting independent film projects under her belt. Among them are&nbsp;No Vacancy and Caged No More. The most notable title on her resume is her role as 'girl #3' in&nbsp;Fred: The Movie.</p><h2 id=madison-s-filmography><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Madison's Filmography</span></h2><p>While she has yet to become a household name, that does not change the fact that Madison has quite the impressive filmography. It's worth boasting about. Her most notable work comes in the form of starring roles in Bad Teacher (a short-lived 2013 CBS show based on the movie of the same name) and a multi-year recurring role on the show,&nbsp;Desperate Housewives.</p><h2 id=madison-s-music><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Madison's Music</span></h2><p>Like most siblings, Madison grew up with aspirations to be just like her big sister. Granted, in this case, those aspirations sound much loftier and hard to reach. That's because her sister is one of the best-selling recording artists on the planet. However, this is Madison's goal nonetheless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To help her little sister reach that goal, Demi has brought Madison on stage with her while on tour, to perform. This happened on multiple occasions. The above example is from her Las Vegas run, where they literally performed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the song, "Together."</a></p><h2 id=madison-s-weight-loss><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Madison's Weight Loss</span></h2><p>As if it was not already obvious in these throwback pics, Madison was always on the curvier side growing up...and that's nothing wrong with that. Now, at the more mature age of 18, she has changed so much. She has yet to dish out any tell-all secrets that let us know how she got so fit, but the change in her appearance is evident.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Throwback Pics Of A Young Demi Lovato</a></span></p><h2 id=when-madison-played-demi><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>When Madison Played Demi</span></h2><p>Even growing up, Madison had aspirations of being an actress and being just like her older sister. The opportunity to bring both ambitions together at a young age came in 2009. At the time, Demi Lovato was still a teenage sensation, starring in Disney Channel's Sonny with a Chance, as Sonny Munroe. In the episode, "Cookie Monsters," Madison got to play a younger version of her older sister.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sisters-are-close-except-for-amber><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sisters Are Close ... Except For Amber</span></h2><p>We seem to know so much about Dallas Lovato and even more about Madison. We even see both sisters frequently pictured with their famous sister, but one missing member of the family is Amber, which is a little odd. We actually have no idea why Amber isn't present in more family pics.</p><p>Our guess is that Amber opts to avoid the limelight (unlike her three sisters, who are all Hollywood actresses). However, there may be some other reason why Amber just isn't that close to her sisters.</p><h2 id=mama-lovato-chronicles-journey-with-daughters-in-her-book><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mama Lovato Chronicles Journey With Daughters In Her Book</span></h2><p>If this list intrigued you and made you want to learn more about the Lovato sisters, and you are just itching for more, because one list isn't enough to whet your appetite, then look no further than the tell-all book written by their mother, Dianna De La Garza. It's called Falling with Wings: A Mother's Story.</p><p>Featuring a Foreward from Demi herself, Garza dishes about her life as an NFL cheerleader, what it's like raising all of her girls, including famous pop sensation, Demi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato's Boyfriend "Wished For Her" For Christmas... 9 Years Later His Wish Came True</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecOepKJlnKTDosDOrGSsoaOpsrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-demi-lovatos-sisters.html&text=Who%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%27s%20Sisters%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-demi-lovatos-sisters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-demi-lovatos-sisters.html&title=Who%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%27s%20Sisters%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-demi-lovatos-sisters.html&title=Who%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%27s%20Sisters%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-demi-lovatos-sisters.html&title=Who%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%27s%20Sisters%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-demi-lovatos-sisters.html&description=Who%20Are%20Demi%20Lovato%27s%20Sisters%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-dave-buy-back-barstool.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Did Dave Portnoy Buy Back Barstool Sports?
