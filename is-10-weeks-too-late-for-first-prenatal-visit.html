Typically women see their healthcare provider for prenatal care between 8 and 12 weeks. If you are seeing a midwife they may suggest you wait until 10 – 12 weeks for your first appointment. This is because this is about the time when you can hear your baby's heartbeat on a doppler.<h2>How far along should you be for your first prenatal visit?</h2>Ideally, you will make an appointment for your first prenatal visit as soon as your pregnancy has been confirmed. Your doctor will likely schedule the appointment around 6 to 8 weeks into your pregnancy. However, they may see you sooner if you: have an existing medical condition.<h2>What happens at a 10 week prenatal appointment?</h2>Visit #2: 10-12 weeks<p>At every visit, your care team will ask about how you're feeling and check a few key things: the growth of your baby and uterus, your weight and your blood pressure.

Once you reach 12 weeks pregnant your baby's spine will have developed, so you can stop taking folic acid if you wish. However you can continue to take supplements after 12 weeks if you choose to and it won't harm your baby to do so.<h2>Is it OK to not take prenatal vitamins during first trimester?</h2>Don't worry if you didn't take prenatal vitamins before you got pregnant. Many women haven't in the past, and they still had healthy babies. Just start taking them as soon as you know you're pregnant.
