Well, OVAN fell into the latter category. But do not underestimate him because does have some experience in MMA.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Physical 100 OVAN Bio to learn more about him.</span></p><h3><b>Meet OVAN, One Of The Contestants On Netflix’s Physical 100</b></h3><p><span>OVAN and 99 other contestants from various ethnicities, ages, and genders came together on </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span> to compete against each other and prove their physical strength. But it wasn’t just the title of “most perfect physique” the participants were fighting for, 300 million won (approx USD 243 thousand) was also on the line!</span></p><p><span>“Fight to the death. Survive to the end.” These were the words that appeared in the show’s trailer. Hinting that the contestants competed to survive purely with their physical strength.</span></p><p><span>In the first ep, OVAN and others were placed in a massive space where plaster casts of their torsos sat on marble pedestals, arranged in concentric circles around a fountain. They then walked around, admiring each other’s plaster/actual bodies, objectifying and judging each other.</span></p><p><span>The show also radiated Squid Game vibes as assistants and safety personnel wore gray jumpsuits with most of their faces covered.</span></p><p><span>So, for the first challenge, the contestants were asked to hang on to a suspended apparatus lifted in the air. Through this, the participants quickly realized that the show was not only a test of brute strength but also endurance and mental strength.</span></p><p><span>Later, based on how long they lasted, the players were then placed in order from 100 to 1, and in order, they got to choose who they’ll face in the first quest — a&nbsp; fight over a ball.</span></p><p><span>Overall, 50 matches took place in the same two arenas, just like </span><i><span>The Challenge</span></i><span>. Yet </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span> stood apart from other gaming shows staging these in much more interesting ways and with a massive cast.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact: </b><span>Before the </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span> premiered (on January 24, 2023), OVAN took to his socials to promote the show a few times. And in one of the posts, he called himself a “Red Monkey.”</span></p><h3><b>Physical 100 OVAN Age</b></h3><p><span>Physical 100 OVAN was 26 years of age when he appeared on the show.</span></p><p><span>However, he was a year younger when he actually started filming. This makes him one of the youngest contestants on </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Physical 100 OVAN Real Name?</b></h3><p><span>Physical 100 OVAN’s real name is Cho Kang-seok.</span></p><p><span>“OVAL” is his stage name.</span></p><h3><b>Physical 100 OVAN Job And Career</b></h3><p><span>OVAN is a singer and rapper, or as he likes to call a “SINGPER”.

Well, if you haven’t, check them out on Spotify or Apple music.</span></p><p><span>His latest single ‘Happiness’ was also supported by Jungkook from BTS.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, OVAN started his musical career in 2016 with his single “Virgin Love.” Soon, he became one of the hottest trendsetters in Korea; especially among teenagers and adults in their 20s.</span></p><p><span>However, many accused OVAN of chart manipulation to gain fame. But since OVAN was innocent, his agency </span><i><span>Romantic Factory</span></i><span> released an official statement as their artist was being attacked to the point where he has been writing messages like “Please save me” on social media.</span></p><p><span>The statement read, “The malicious commenters whom we sued were sentenced to fines or given suspended sentences conditioned upon receiving proper education. Therefore, the police, prosecution, and judiciary have acknowledged that ‘chart manipulation’ [sajaegi] was a false rumor.”</span></p><p><span>Also, to convince the haters, they added that OVAN wasn’t a completely unknown singer who had had no results prior to his recent chart-in. “Our artist has proven that he could very well rank within the Top 10 on Melon’s real-time chart and No. 1 on Genie’s real-time chart,” they remarked.</span></p><p><span>Well, that’s all in the past. Now, OVAN’s an established singer/rapper, and also so reality star.</span></p><p><span>Besides </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span>, he’s also graced the stage of </span><i><span>Breakers</span></i><span> (2018), </span><i><span>Mixnine </span></i><span>(2017), </span><i><span>King of Mask Singer</span></i><span> (2015), and </span><i><span>Immortal Songs: Singing the Legend</span></i><span> (2011).</span></p><h3><b>Physical 100 OVAN Height</b></h3><p><span>Physical 100 OVAN stands tall at a height of above 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm).</span></p><p><span>His distinct features include — an oblong face, a fit body, and a lion tattoo on his chest.</span></p><h3><b>Does Physical 100 OVAN Have A Girlfriend?</b></h3><p><span>Physical 100 OVAN was together with his girlfriend Hayoung for over 4 years.</span></p><p><span>The two celebrated their 4th anniversary on June 8, 2020.</span></p><p><span>Their 4th anniversary was also the day, OVAN first revealed his girlfriend to the world via an IG post, “I was afraid that my love might be hurt, I have hidden it until now, but now that it’s open to the public, I’m beside me for a long time, telling me who I really am I hope you will love and love us a lot with the lover who gave me,” he wrote.</span></p><p><span>Also, the rapper added that his girlfriend had been watching him since he was 20 years old.
