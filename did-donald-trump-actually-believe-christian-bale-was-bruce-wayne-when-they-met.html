Bale has denied being a method actor, but he has shown the uncanny ability to transform into his characters. Did Trump possibly think Bale was a method actor?

Many fans have likely doubted Bale will ever return to the role of the Caped Crusader. But would he?</p><p>According to WovieWeb, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bale said he would play Batman again if Christopher Nolan asked</a> him. The Public Enemies actor told Inverse, "The thing for me is that Chris Nolan and I always said, If we're lucky enough to do three, we'll do three and leave it at that."</p><p>"We were lucky enough to do three and stay true to our word. That's loyalty. You've got to stick to a deal. If Chris came to me and said, 'I've got a new story,' I'd be interested. But other than that, I don't think so."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Christian Bale Thinks Actually Happened At The End Of 'The Dark Knight Rises'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At another time, Bale spoke of working in that part again with Nolan. He said, "In my mind, it would be something if Chris Nolan ever said to himself, 'You know what, I've got another story to tell.' And if he wished to tell that story with me, I'd be in."</p><p><a href=#>Christian Bale has often pushed himself to the limit for his roles</a>, proving his ability to take on a variety of different characters. Perhaps this is why Donald Trump seemed to be - or was - fooled when the two met in the Trump Tower in 2011.</p><h2 id=donald-trump-acted-like-christian-bale-was-bruce-wayne-when-they-met>Donald Trump Acted Like Christian Bale Was Bruce Wayne When They Met</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar47805664.jpg><p>Christian Bale played Bruce Wayne/Batman in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The films were darker in tone than previous Batman films, and had grounded, more realistic characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to IndieWire, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Bale has said Donald Trump thought he was Bruce Wayne in real life</a> when they met in 2011 when the Batman Begins actor was filming The Dark Knight Rises, years before Trump was elected president. Bale says Trump acted as if he actually was his character, Bruce Wayne.</p><p>Bale told Variety, "I met him, one time. We were filming on Batman in Trump Tower and he said, 'Come on up to the office.' I think he thought that I was Bruce Wayne because I was dressed as Bruce Wayne."</p><p>The Vice actor added, "So he talked to me like I was Bruce Wayne and I just went along with it, really. It was quite entertaining. I had no idea at the time that he would think about running for president."</p><p>Donald Trump might not follow comics, and it could be possible for someone who doesn't really know who Bruce Wayne is to confuse that name with the name of someone who is playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. Another possibility is that Trump could have been playing some sort of wild joke on Bale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If so, it seems odd Trump never broke the act, nor revealed to Bale that he was joking. If Trump was just kidding around, he left Bale forever wondering whether or not he actually believes Bale is Bruce Wayne/Batman.</p><p>However, Trump might have thought Bale was a method actor, as <a href=#>Bale has been known for his transformations in roles, like the one he underwent for Thor: Love and Thunder</a>.</p><h2 id=what-has-bale-said-about-method-acting>What Has Bale Said About Method Acting?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ChristianBaleTheDarkKnight.jpg><p>Several fans consider Christian Bale one of the best celebrities to portray the Bruce Wayne role he brought to life in Christopher Nolan's gritty Dark Knight Trilogy.

Several articles before, during and after 2011 have stated Bale is a method actor.</p><p>A method actor stays in character even when not filming. Bale told UNILAD that from his point-of-view, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he isn't a method actor, and he doesn't know why people think he is</a>, despite what he has done to take on certain roles. Bale said, "You know, people call me that. And I don't really even know what that is. I just kind of wing it."</p><p>"Method actors study method acting. I've never studied any acting at all. I just don't want to offend true method actors. I just do whatever I do.
