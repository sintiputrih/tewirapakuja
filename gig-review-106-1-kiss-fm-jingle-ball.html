Nothing could prepare me to see One Direction for what would be the last time for over a year. The outcome was as heartbreaking as expected.</p><p>I answered a phone call from my best friend two weeks before the show to her screaming, “ALEXA I WON TICKETS WE’RE GOING TO JINGLE BALL!” Not only were we going to Jingle Ball, FOR FREE, but we were in the 6th row next to the stage. We had also won DNCE meet and greets, so I would be meeting the beloved Joe Jonas as well.</p><p>The venue was completely packed with crazy fans as this would be one of One Direction’s final US performances before the break. Fans were thrown into a frenzy when the lineup had originally been announced because One Direction had skipped Texas, and the south of the United States as a whole, during their On The Road Again Tour, leaving most fans in the area without an opportunity to see them. This made the Jingle Ball excitement all the more insane. Every fan in Texas and the surrounding states seemed to be in Dallas that Tuesday night to see their beloved boys take their final bow in the Lone Star State.</p><p>The order of acts was kept a secret until the start of the show, with the exception of 5 Seconds of Summer who were to open. I got to my ridiculously close seat and tried to prepare myself for what was to come. The radio hosts came on stage and it was time. 5 Seconds of Summer were up first.</p><p>5 Seconds of Summer opened with classic “She Looks So Perfect,” leading right into current radio hit “Hey Everybody!” They then slowed things down with last year’s radio single “Amnesia,” and the next single off their sophomore album “Sounds Good Feels Good,” “Jet Black Heart.” The boys took a few moments to talk, but were pretty rushed due to the nature of the Jingle Ball shows. They ended with their hit single “She’s Kinda Hot.”</p><p>Without any time between acts, DNCE came on next. Led by former Jonas Brothers frontman Joe Jonas, DNCE played upbeat synth led pop jams. Their single “Cake By the Ocean” merited the greatest excitement from the audience, but every song kept the crowd on their feet.</p><p>Next came ZEDD, hit DJ who played an incredible thirty minute set. He remixed through his classic hits “Clarity” and “Stay the Night,” while also bringing the house down with his new hits “Beautiful Now” and collaboration with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez “I Want You To Know.” DJ sets are surprisingly fun at shows like these. The way masters like ZEDD entertain the audience and get them amped up for the next act is impressive. The visual effects also make these sets extra enjoyable.</p><p>Next, I left my seat to go meet DNCE. I missed two reportedly rocking sets by Ellie Goulding and Tove Lo, but got to give Joe Jonas a hug, so I wasn’t disappointed. DNCE was incredibly kind and friendly, each member taking the time to give a hug to the fans meeting them.</p><p>After the meet and greet, I ran back to my seat to see Shawn Mendes. He sang his chart topping hit “Stitches” with just his acoustic guitar to fans almost as loud as when 5 Seconds of Summer opened the show. The highlight of his set however was definitely when surprise guest Camila Cabello took the stage for their song “I Know What You Did Last Summer.”</p><p>After Mendes was the act everyone was waiting for, One Direction. The radio hosts came to announce the boys and the chorus of screams that ensued afterwards was ear-shattering. The boys opened with the first single off the new album “Made In The A.M.,” “Drag Me Down.” Harry then took a moment to say hello to fans and express the boys’ excitement at being back in Dallas. The boys then went into new song “History,” followed by their single “Perfect,” (my favorite song). The energy in the room kept building with every song and second. Liam then took the time to talk and introduce the next song, his “favourite on the album,” “A.M.” The fans went absolutely ballistic. Tears started to fall even faster than before. Notable moment here was when Harry stuck out his butt during the line “talking out of our asses.” The boys then continued the tear-fest with “Love You Goodbye.”</p><p>This marked a turning point in the set for what Liam called “the golden oldies” beginning with their first single “What Makes You Beautiful.” Niall then took a moment to talk about how much the boys love Dallas. He said they fondly remember the city for the “fan day” held back in 2012 when the boys had their first US performance to 10,000 fans at Dr. Pepper Ballpark just outside of Dallas. That brought on an extra wave of emotion for many fans, including myself, who consider that day one of their fondest memories, and knowing 1D remembered it too made it all the more special.</p><p>Louis took a moment then to introduce “No Control” by thanking the fans for all their work making it a single and showing their constant love and support. The boys followed with “Story of My Life” and ended with single “Infinity” which included fireworks and brought the show to a fantastic peak. The boys exited the stage and everyone felt a mixture of happiness and great sorrow for the end of the show.</p><p>Calvin Harris came on next to revamp energy, followed by Demi Lovato closing out the show, but many fans seemed to leave after One Direction finished their set. It is to be said though that Calvin and Demi both had incredible performances. Calvin’s skills at mixing his songs on stage is incredible and the visual effects were even more impressive. Demi’s vocals cannot be compared to many artists as her range is unbelievable.</p><p>Overall the evening left me speechless and wishing I could afford a plane ticket to California so I could try to live it all over again. The evening was, to put it best, Perfect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktKqzjKucr6GVrHpyfJVmaGajmajAbrLMZqGippehsm6uwKWjaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgig-review-106-1-kiss-fm-jingle-ball.html&text=Gig%20Review%3a%20106.1%20KISS%20FM%20Jingle%20Ball&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgig-review-106-1-kiss-fm-jingle-ball.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgig-review-106-1-kiss-fm-jingle-ball.html&title=Gig%20Review%3a%20106.1%20KISS%20FM%20Jingle%20Ball" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgig-review-106-1-kiss-fm-jingle-ball.html&title=Gig%20Review%3a%20106.1%20KISS%20FM%20Jingle%20Ball" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgig-review-106-1-kiss-fm-jingle-ball.html&title=Gig%20Review%3a%20106.1%20KISS%20FM%20Jingle%20Ball" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgig-review-106-1-kiss-fm-jingle-ball.html&description=Gig%20Review%3a%20106.1%20KISS%20FM%20Jingle%20Ball" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./linda-mcingvale-meet-mattress-mack-wife-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Linda McIngvale: Meet Mattress Mack Wife And Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alicia-silverstone.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alicia Silverstone News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
