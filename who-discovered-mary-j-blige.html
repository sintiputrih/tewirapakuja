Blige has been creating outstanding R&B music</a>. She is an icon of empowerment, revolution, and motivation, and she is among the leading voices of the modern music age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blige has established herself as a global phenomenon, with eight multi-platinum records, nine Grammy Awards with a whopping 32 nominations, two Academy Award nominations, two Golden Globe nominations, and a SAG nomination among many other honors.</p><h2 id=mary-j-blige-39-s-musical-career-beginnings>Mary J. Blige's Musical Career Beginnings</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary's debut album, What's the 411?</a>, was released in July 1992. It was a rare fusion of two disparate musical styles, soul and hip-hop, yet it was well-received by the audience. 'Real Love' and 'You Remind Me,' two hits from the record, became extremely well-known, and the American music business welcomed a new period known as Mary J. Blige.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>My Life, her second album, was launched in 1995. It softened down the hip-hop aspect while expressing the sufferings she has been through in her private life. It <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared to aim for an inner connection with the audience</a>, which it achieved.</p><p>'My Life' garnered a Grammy nomination for 'Best R&B Album' in 1996. 'My Life' also led to the end of her collaborations with many close friends and the 'Uptown' label. Blige has also dabbled with acting. In 2001, she made her first appearance with the song 'Prison Song,' She <a href=#>had made a cameo on The Jamie Foxx Show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to star in films like Rock of Ages and Mudbound, a historical drama. For her portrayal in Mudbound, Mary won worldwide critical acclaim as well as a slew of accolades and nominations. Readers can deduce how significant Mary J. Blige is in the hip-hop soul music world based on her career, but the question is, who discovered Mary J. Blige?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Mary J. Blige Responded To Her Super Bowl Haters</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-mary-j-blige-get-discovered>How Did Mary J. Blige Get Discovered?</h2><p>No discussion of Blige's success would be complete without mentioning Andre Harrell, the founder of Uptown Records, who spotted her in the Schlobohm housing complexes in Yonkers and signed her right away. Blige, born in New York, began captivating audiences with her deep voice when she signed a deal with Harrell's Uptown Records in 1989 at the age of 18 and became the label's youngest and first female singer at the MCA-distributed record.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harrell, who died on May 7, 2020, was interviewed before his death for Mary Blige's Amazon Prime Documentary, My Life. Blige told The Hollywood Reporter that she still doesn't have enough words to express his impact on her life. "In the music world, AndrÃ© is actually my father. I wouldn't be here right now if he hadn't actually come to those projects that day to my flat," she claimed, stressing that the record was rolling at the times with chart-topping talents like Jodeci and Guy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Did Mary J.

His groundbreaking work in music, television, and film established him as among Black culture's most powerful figures, opening the path for other futurists to continue in his footsteps. He was hip-hop but in a handmade tuxedo, and he was always dressed to impress.</p><p>Andre Harrell was an inventive music businessman who launched Uptown Records in the late 1980s, a vital link between the realms of hip-hop and R&B. Harrell was the one who gave Sean Combs his first break, making him <a href=#>one of hip hop's behemoths and global ambassadors</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andre Harrell's untimely death on May 9, 2020 shocked the music industry. Harrell, who was 59 at the point of his demise, was focusing on his most recent project, a miniseries about the legacy of Uptown Records, the company he started.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This R&B Star Almost Took â€˜Buy U A Drinkâ€™ From T-Pain</a></span></p><h2 id=andre-harrell-39-s-contributions-to-the-industry>Andre Harrell's Contributions To The Industry</h2><p>Mr. Harrell was at the epicenter when hip-hop was exploding in the early to mid-1980s as a rapper and entrepreneur. But his musical perspective wasn't necessarily the same as his colleagues'; he sought a touch of elegance and a style that could appeal to both older and younger generations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andre Harrell established a place for performers that fused hip-hop bravado with conventional R&B finesse, who had both a smooth texture and harsh edges when he started Uptown Records in 1986. It was among the most musically significant and commercially successful record companies in the US for about a decade.</p><p>Uptown was quickly successful, and in 1988, they formed a relationship with MCA, a big record company. Uptown was among the most consistent hit makers in the music biz by the early 1990s. It also introduced two of the most important R&B performers of the 1990s and beyond: Jodeci, a four-man vocal group that merged raw vitality with church-trained emotion, and Mary J. Blige, who refined her calloused grief and went on to become one of spirit music's greatest talents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harrell could have staked a claim in helping to create two styles of Black music that would go on to affect the industry for the next three decades and beyond.</p><p>Mary J. Blige is unquestionably among the most influential figures in hip-hop soul and the music world, as well as one of Harrell's talent scouts. While the music business is fortunate to have Blige, they are equally devastated by Harrell's untimely death.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Designer Behind Mary J Bligeâ€™s Coat Started Out As An Engineer</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddmba0r86vnKudlGK6or7YZqFmmpyetKZ7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-discovered-mary-j-blige.html&text=Who%20Actually%20Discovered%20Mary%20J.%20Blige%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-discovered-mary-j-blige.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-discovered-mary-j-blige.html&title=Who%20Actually%20Discovered%20Mary%20J.%20Blige%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-discovered-mary-j-blige.html&title=Who%20Actually%20Discovered%20Mary%20J.%20Blige%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-discovered-mary-j-blige.html&title=Who%20Actually%20Discovered%20Mary%20J.%20Blige%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-discovered-mary-j-blige.html&description=Who%20Actually%20Discovered%20Mary%20J.%20Blige%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-amber-heards-friend-joshua-drew.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Amber Heard's Friend Joshua Drew?
