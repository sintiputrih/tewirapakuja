For example, a former sheriff and a former head of the Mississippi Department of Corrections were housed at Seagoville as of 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_a-former-friend-of-josh-duggar-s-was-shocked-to-be-called-as-a-witness-but-proved-josh-s-story-didn-t-add-up-_bk_a2_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="A Former Friend Of Josh Duggar's Was Shocked To Be Called As A Witness (But Proved Josh's Story Didn't Add Up)">A Former Friend Of Josh Duggar's Was Shocked To Be Called As A Witness (But Proved Josh's Story Didn't Add Up)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A former friend of Josh Duggar's was called as a witness, and his testimony may have proven that Josh was lying.</p><p>The point Accurso seemed intent on making was that the "sex offender prisons" are actually some of the safest for high-profile people since the media is keeping an eye out for any news or infractions.</p><p>As far as how Josh is behind bars, though inmate Accurso admitted he hadn't personally met Josh Duggar, he heard about him from a friend and saw him one time. The friend said Josh was a "regular, nice guy," but "everybody was trying to talk to him."</p><p>Accurso said he saw Duggar doing a workout video, but they didn't interact at the time. As far as reputations go, however, Duggar seemed well-liked, though uninterested in "trying to build [his] brand" behind bars.</p><h2 id=critics-were-unimpressed-with-the-inmate-39-s-perspective>Critics Were Unimpressed With The Inmate's Perspective</h2><h3 id=josh-duggar-39-s-fellow-inmate-was-also-convicted-of-crimes-similar-to-josh-39-s>Josh Duggar's fellow inmate was also convicted of crimes similar to Josh's</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/anna-might-have-been-blindsided-by-josh-duggar-s-proposal-and-forced-to-say-yes-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Redditors pointed out after reading the inmate's piece, the person defending Josh Duggar was also behind bars for a similar crime; possession of inappropriate material depicting children.</p><p>Anthony Accurso's bio on The Marshall Project website notes that he "is a writer and paralegal who believes carceral punishment only makes the problem of crime worse.

He hangs out with other sex offenders who [think] he's a nice guy."</p><p>One Redditor wrote, "Grossed out by this author, a convicted and imprisoned sex offender, who does not appear to have remorse or understand his own crimes. And who openly fan-girls Josh Duggar."</p><h2 id=fgi-seagoville-is-reportedly-not-as-quot-scary-quot-as-reported>FGI Seagoville Is Reportedly Not As "Scary" As Reported</h2><h3 id=seagoville-may-be-a-high-profile-prison-but-it-39-s-not-lawless>Seagoville may be a high-profile prison, but it's not lawless</h3><p>According to the insider at Seagoville, it "isn’t the violent and scary prison the media made it out to be."

It's unclear whether Josh Duggar has committed (or been ordered) to complete any treatment program. There has also been speculation that <a href=#>Josh might be moved to a different prison after he was caught with contraband</a>.</p><p>As one Redditor said of Josh and other inmates like him, "Watching CSA materials is not a victimless crime." This was the stark opposite of what inmate Accurso conveyed in his piece, leading critics to theorize that Josh is living among sympathizers who also don't feel that they are criminals, despite their convictions stating otherwise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrewv8dmm66fl5a%2FbrXSZqOio5Vitq95z6ugrKeeZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-josh-duggar-is-like-in-prison.html&text=Josh%20Duggar%27s%20Fellow%20Inmate%20Claims%20Josh%20Is%20A%20%26quot%3bRegular%2c%20Nice%26quot%3b%20Guy%20Behind%20Bars&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-josh-duggar-is-like-in-prison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-josh-duggar-is-like-in-prison.html&title=Josh%20Duggar%27s%20Fellow%20Inmate%20Claims%20Josh%20Is%20A%20%26quot%3bRegular%2c%20Nice%26quot%3b%20Guy%20Behind%20Bars" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-josh-duggar-is-like-in-prison.html&title=Josh%20Duggar%27s%20Fellow%20Inmate%20Claims%20Josh%20Is%20A%20%26quot%3bRegular%2c%20Nice%26quot%3b%20Guy%20Behind%20Bars" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-josh-duggar-is-like-in-prison.html&title=Josh%20Duggar%27s%20Fellow%20Inmate%20Claims%20Josh%20Is%20A%20%26quot%3bRegular%2c%20Nice%26quot%3b%20Guy%20Behind%20Bars" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-josh-duggar-is-like-in-prison.html&description=Josh%20Duggar%27s%20Fellow%20Inmate%20Claims%20Josh%20Is%20A%20%26quot%3bRegular%2c%20Nice%26quot%3b%20Guy%20Behind%20Bars" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-truth-about-elon-musks-relationship-with-his-father.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Elon Musk's Relationship With His Father">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jeremy-gabriel-is-dead.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeremy Gabriel Is Dead: Flint Michigan Resident has tragically Passed Away in a Fatal Motorcycle Cra">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
