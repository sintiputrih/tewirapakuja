Indiana Jones is one most beloved characters in film history, and certainly, one of the most popular franchises to come out of the <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong> and <strong>George Lucas</strong> era. Inspired by their love of serialized adventures on TV and pulp magazines, Lucas sold the idea of the character to Spielberg as a better American replacement for James Bond, and Spielberg went on to deliver one of the most defining films of the 80s with<strong> Raiders of the Lost Ark</strong>, and then the subsequent trilogy. Despite being generally beloved, some of those bridges were burnt when Spielberg tried to bring back Indiana Jones in <strong>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull </strong>and the film opened to mixed reception. But now, with <a href=#><strong>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny </strong>(2023)</a>, the Indiana Jones franchise is looking to go back to its original glory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With this film, director <strong>James Mangold</strong> is taking on the directing duties from Steven Spielberg for the first time in the franchise. Mangold is an accomplished filmmaker with a vision to deliver great old-fashioned motion pictures, as evident from his acclaimed ventures <strong>Logan</strong> and <strong>Ford v Ferrari</strong>. Indy is joined by a string of new characters in this adventure, along with some returning favorites, all played by exciting names. So here's a list of who's who in the fifth Indiana Jones film.</p><p>Editor's Note: This article was updated on July 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny">Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</a></h5>PG-13<p class=display-card-description><br>Archaeologist Indiana Jones races against time to retrieve a legendary artifact that can change the course of history.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>June 30, 2023</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>James Mangold</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>142 minutes</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Adventure</a></span> <strong>Writers</strong> <span>Jon Kasdan , Philip Kaufman , David Koepp , George Lucas</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>New 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' Trailer Shows a Race Against Time</a></span></p><h2 id=harrison-ford-as-indiana-jones>Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones</h2><p>It's not an Indiana Jones movie without Harrison Ford. Initially, when it was announced that Lucasfilm was developing Indiana Jones 5, there were talks of a recast with a potential younger actor, with names like <strong>Christ Pratt</strong> being thrown in the mix. And owing to Harrison's age and his distaste for franchise fare off late (Ford asked to be killed off in <strong>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</strong>), it made sense. But thankfully, Ford is not ready to let go of Indiana Jones just yet. He made the character what it is, and watching him play Indy at least one more time is bound to be a most satisfying experience, and one of the biggest reasons to watch this movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The last time we saw the archeologist, he was reinstated as a history professor at Marshall College and married Marion Ravenwood. Dial of Destiny picks up with the character's story in 1969, as Indy faces a changing world where he no longer feels he fits in. His personal life lies in shambles and his colleagues are just waiting for him to retire, so when his estranged goddaughter comes back into his life, it's a much-needed chance for him to feel like himself again. The film also has a lot of sequences set in the past, where we see <a href=#>a de-aged Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones in his prime</a>.</p><h2 id=phoebe-waller-bridge-as-helena-shaw>Phoebe Waller-Bridge As Helena Shaw</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/phoebe-waller-bridge-as-helena-in-indiana-jones-5.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fleabag</strong> and <strong>Killing Eve</strong> creator <a href=#><strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong></a> plays Indiana Jones' goddaughter, Helena - the daughter of one of Jones' former friends played by <strong>Toby Jones</strong>. The Emmy-winning actress has previously worked with Lucasfilm on <strong>Solo: A Star Wars Story</strong> and was reportedly handpicked by studio president <strong>Kathleen Kennedy</strong> for this project. James Mangold describes Waller-Bridge's character as the catalyst of the film, who brings Indy back to adventure by dragging him into her problems.</p><p>While Helena is presented as an adventurer on par with Indy at his best, she also has a rather complicated past. Helena isn't a simple, wide-eyed sidekick and she has her own agenda, which may not always align with what Indy wants.</p><h2 id=ethann-isidore-as-teddy-kumar>Ethann Isidore as Teddy Kumar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/indiana-jones-5-ethann-isidore-character-poster-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A sneaky youngster who's basically Helena's <a href=#>Short Round</a>, Teddy is an aspiring pilot and Helena's right hand in all her schemes.

Teddy is played by <strong>Ethann Isidore</strong>, who makes his film debut in this movie. The young actor has previously acted in series like <strong>Mortel</strong> and <strong>Sam</strong>.</p><h2 id=mads-mikkelsen-as-j-uuml-rgen-voller>Mads Mikkelsen as Jürgen Voller</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/indiana-jones-the-dial-of-destiny-mads-mikkelsen.jpeg><p>Playing the foil to Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones is the ever-iconic <a href=#><strong>Mads Mikkelsen</strong></a>. The Danish actor has played many tough and celebrated characters over the course of his accomplished career, in films and shows like <strong>Another Round</strong>, <strong>The Hunt</strong>, <strong>Hannibal</strong>, and <strong>Casino Royale</strong>, and was last seen playing the villain Grindelwald in <strong>Fantastic Beasts: Secrets of Dumbledore</strong>. Mikkelsen is playing a former Nazi, who has crossed paths with Indy in the past and is now a NASA scientist. While acclaimed for his efforts towards making the Moon Landing happen, Voller's true goals are far more nefarious, and the only one standing in his way is Indiana Jones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=boyd-holbrook-as-klaber>Boyd Holbrook as Klaber</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/indiana_jones_dial_of_destiny_trailer-13.jpg><p>Klaber is Voller's rather unstable right-hand man in the present timeline, who tries to stop Indy and the gang in the movie.

His character Renaldo is a Spanish sailor and diver who helps Indy and Helena in their quest.
