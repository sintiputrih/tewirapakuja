Having a character killed off in a show is nothing new, and it just had to be done to make an impact on the show. Viewers may think that the writers are having a good time writing off characters, but some writers experience emotional time writing the script for a death scene, just like when writers had to write the <a href=#>most memorable death scene on The Sopranos</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some deaths in TV series are just unexpected and some are just unnecessary.
