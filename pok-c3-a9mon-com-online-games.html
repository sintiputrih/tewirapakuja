Players rotate the leaves so that one whole ring contains only leaves of a single color (either red or green, not both) at which point the ring disappears and any leaves above it fall in its place. Initially, players gain 49 points plus points for the amount of rings removed until that point, with players being unable to make black leaves disappear. However, when 8 red rings or 8 green rings are cleared out (indicated by the red and green bars on the bottom of the screen), the game enters a mode known as 'Power Mode', in which a ~2.1× multiplier is given for each ring cleared, with the black leaves turning into silver ones and becoming clearable. From here, and in the same manner, players potentially upgrade to 'Double Power Mode', in which the silver leaves turn gold and a ~2.5× multiplier is applied, and finally, 'Triple Power Mode' in which the gold leaves become rainbow leaves (which may be matched with any color) and a ~3.5× multiplier is applied. Players instantly achieve a variation of 'Triple Power Mode' by filling both red and green bars simultaneously. However, in this case, a multiplier of about ~4.5× is applied for clearing rings.

Most notably, it allowed players to obtain <a href=# title=Eeveelution>an evolution</a> of <a href=# title="Eevee (Pokémon)">Eevee</a> via the <a href=# title="Pokémon Global Link">Pokémon Global Link</a> from 19 May 2011 — these Pokémon have their Hidden Ability. Because of this, players needed to be signed into their <a href=# title=Pokémon.com>Pokémon Trainer Club</a> accounts to play it.</p><p>The game consisted of four levels wherein players broke blocks and caught orbs that fell from the blocks. Players earned points by hitting blocks. Hitting blocks consecutively while not hitting the pad increased the points earned by a hundred per hit. Points earned went back to a hundred after hitting the pad. Orbs caught meritted 500 points each. In order to brake blocks, players used their mouse to move the pad, make the ball bounce, and prevent it from falling. After falling, players lost lives, of which only three were available at the start of the game. However, more could be obtained during the progression of the game. The game was over when players had no more lives. To help players and maybe even make things harder for them, power-ups were available at each of the levels.</p><p>The orbs caught corresponded to an evolution of <a href=# title="Eevee (Pokémon)">Eevee</a> that could be obtained after completing the game. At the end of the game, a random orb was chosen out of all those obtained during each of the four levels. Players were allowed to choose whether to keep the <a href=# title=Evolution>evolution</a> or not. They may play again if they choose not to in order to obtain another evolution. If the player chose to keep the chosen evolution, they could not obtain another one in their Trainer Club account. To confirm that players had in fact chosen an evolution, they merely had to refresh the page and a message popped up mentioning what they had chosen.</p><p>The <a href=# title=Evolution>evolutions</a> of <a href=# title="Eevee (Pokémon)">Eevee</a> were obtainable on the Pokémon Global Link from 19 May to 31 August 2011.</p><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Orbs>Orbs</span></h5><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Power-ups_2>Power-ups</span></h5><table><tbody><tr><th>Power-up</th><th>Affected</th><th>Levels available</th></tr><tr><td>Extra Big</td><td rowspan=2>Pad</td><td rowspan=2>1, 4</td></tr><tr><td>Extra Small</td></tr><tr><td>Speed Down</td><td rowspan=2>Ball</td><td rowspan=2>2-4</td></tr><tr><td>Speed Up</td></tr><tr><td>Sticky Pad</td><td>Pad</td><td rowspan=2>3-4</td></tr><tr><td>Extra Life!</td><td>Player</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Pre-revamp_games>Pre-revamp games</span></h3><p>The following games were available at Pokémon.com prior to January 11, 2010.</p><h4><span id=Switch-a-Roo.21></span><span class=mw-headline id=Switch-a-Roo!>Switch-a-Roo!</span></h4><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/c/c4/Switch_a_Roo.png/450px-Switch_a_Roo.png decoding=async width=300 height=163 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Switch-a-Roo!<p><b>Switch-a-Roo!</b> was a game that was introduced before the site was revamped.
