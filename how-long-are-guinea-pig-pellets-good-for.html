Try to feed them within 3 months of their sell-by date.<h2>How often should I change my guinea pigs pellets?</h2>Replace pellets on a daily basis. Guinea pigs often kick bedding material or droppings into their food bowls and stale pellets will have little, if any, vitamin C.<h2>How do you store guinea pig pellets?</h2>Guinea pig pellets shouldn't be stored in the fridge but should be kept in a dry, cool and dark place. Avoid placing them next to a radiator or in direct sunlight. If you're leaving them in the packet they were bought in, make sure it is completely sealed as light will reduce the vitamin C content.<h2>Do Guinea Pigs Really NEED Pellets?</h2><p></p><h2>Do guinea pigs need vegetables every day?</h2>Guinea pigs' need fresh greens and vegetables every day to help them get enough vitamin C (they can't produce it themselves). Our vets' advise one teacup of greens and veg, per guinea pig, per day, which can be split into morning and evening feeds.<h2>Which guinea pig pellets are best?</h2><p>A-Z-Animals Top Picks for Guinea Pig Pellets</p><ul><li>Kaytee Timothy Complete Guinea Pig Food.</li><li>Oxbow Essentials Cavy Cuisine Adult Guinea Pig Food.</li><li>Mazuri Timothy-Based Guinea Pig Food.</li><li>Kaytee Supreme Fortified Daily Diet Guinea Pig Food.</li></ul><h2>How many guinea pig pellets a day?</h2>Guinea pigs should be given a pellet based food - about 1/8 cup per guinea pig per day (for pregnant, nursing, or guinea pigs 6 months or less, pellets should be available at all times even if this means feeding more than 1/8 cup per day).<h2>How often should you replace guinea pigs water?</h2>You should change the water in your pets' bottle at least once a day, and more often in warmer weather. You should also check it periodically throughout the day to make sure it hasn't run dry.<h2>How often do you have to change the hay in a guinea pig cage?</h2>I change each one area each day, throwing out all the hay. Hay trays are topped up twice a day with hay and once a day with fresh grass.<h2>What pellets should guinea pigs avoid?</h2>1/8 cup of pellets per day is suggested to prevent obesity. Avoid mixes with nuts, corn, seeds and fruit. Guinea pigs cannot digest these rich ingredients.<h2>What are guinea pig pellets made of?</h2>Most guinea pig pellets are alfalfa based. Alfalfa pellets are suitable for young, growing and pregnant guinea pigs. After your guinea pig is about a year old and fully developed (see notes), a timothy based pellet, which provides less calcium, may be a good choice.<h2>Can a guinea pig survive without pellets?</h2>However, pellet food is not needed if you are careful to round out the remainder of the diet. Guinea pigs do best on a wide variety of foods, including multiple types of grass hays, several different vegetables (preferably that contain vitamin C) and lots of fresh water.<h2>Are guinea pig pellets necessary?</h2>Adult Guinea Pig<p>Pellets aren't strictly necessary. So many of them are full of rubbish anyway, essentially just junk food for piggies. But like @Cavy Kung-Fu said, You would really have to know what you're doing and make sure they're getting everything they need from their hay/veggies and lots of grass.</p><h2>How much pellets should I feed 2 guinea pigs?</h2>Feeding Your Guinea Pig<p>Offer 1/8 cup of pellets per day for a 2 pound guinea pig. Hay should be available at all times. At least 1/2 -1 cup of fresh leafy greens or other vitamin C rich vegetables should be offered daily.</p><h2>Do guinea pigs prefer water bottles or bowls?</h2>Water bottles are preferred by most owners and experts as the best way to provide clean, fresh water to guinea pigs. However, water bowls are a safe alternative if your guinea pig is elderly, injured, or simply dislikes using water bottles.<h2>Should you cover a guinea pig cage at night?</h2>Covering the whole cage at night can create problems and affect your guinea pigs breathing. That means that you should only cover part of their cage at night. This ensures that the cage remains properly ventilated while still letting in some light.<h2>Can guinea pigs drink tap water?</h2>If you drink tap water, that's fine for your guinea pigs.<h2>Can you overfeed a guinea pig?</h2>Overfeeding can be damaging to your guinea pig's digestion tract, and cause obesity. To prevent yourself from overfeeding your guinea pig, all you need to do is serve your guinea pigs the right portioned meals and cut down on unnecessary sugary treats.<h2>How often should guinea pigs be fed?</h2>Feed your guinea pig on a consistent scheduleâ€”twice a day, morning and evening. Because guinea pigs will overeat if given the chance, be sure not to overfeed pelleted food, as it is predominantly carbohydrate and can lead to diarrhea and decreased appetite.<h2>How long can guinea pigs go without food?</h2>So, how long can guinea pigs go without food and water? Healthy guinea pigs shouldn't go over 8 hours without food. They won't starve in this time, but they can develop potentially fatal GI stasis or other health issues. Healthy guinea pigs may go up to 24 hours without water.<h2>What is the healthiest food for guinea pigs?</h2>The preferred basic diet for guinea pigs is unlimited amounts of Timothy or other low-calcium hay, supplemented with smaller amounts of a commercial, high-fiber, Timothy-hay based guinea pig pellets. Vitamin C (see below) should be given each day. Hay should be offered free-choice throughout the day.<h2>Are grain free pellets better for guinea pigs?</h2>Kind to teeth with no added sugars or artificial colours, Selective Naturals Grain Free is blended with natural linseed, to help promote clear skin and a glossy coat. It helps to keep guinea pigs as healthy on the outside as they are on the inside. That's why vets recommend Selective.<h2>Are Timothy biscuits good for guinea pigs?</h2>Kaytee Timothy Biscuits Baked with Apple not only provide healthy ingredients like vitamins, minerals, hay, and apples, but they also help keep your guinea pig's teeth trimmed.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormakn6O0bq3RnmSgrZmjsqJ5z6KeZqiVobmmwNJmnqinlGKzsL4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-long-are-guinea-pig-pellets-good-for.html&text=How%20long%20are%20guinea%20pig%20pellets%20good%20for%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-long-are-guinea-pig-pellets-good-for.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-long-are-guinea-pig-pellets-good-for.html&title=How%20long%20are%20guinea%20pig%20pellets%20good%20for%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-long-are-guinea-pig-pellets-good-for.html&title=How%20long%20are%20guinea%20pig%20pellets%20good%20for%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-long-are-guinea-pig-pellets-good-for.html&title=How%20long%20are%20guinea%20pig%20pellets%20good%20for%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-long-are-guinea-pig-pellets-good-for.html&description=How%20long%20are%20guinea%20pig%20pellets%20good%20for%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shark-fin-soup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Shark Fin Soup Is Driving Some Species To Extinction">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./amd-expands-g-series-embedded-socs-with-excavator-microarchitecture.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="AMD Expands G-Series Embedded SoCs with Excavator Microarchitecture">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
