Now that you can flash a smile, you may have some stains or yellowing that need to be addressed — especially as the mask mandate has been lifted in many states.</p><p>If your chompers aren’t ready for the limelight because they are a lemony-yellow hue, keep reading.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>SmileDirectClub</a> conducted a survey on what Americans are looking forward to as masks come off, and their results were pretty on the nose with what you’d expect. Conducted by OnePulse Survey, they found that nearly 60% of the respondents are looking forward to seeing peoples’ smiles again and 87% had a desire for whiter teeth.</p><p>But what exactly is teeth whitening anyway, on a scientific level? We asked dentists to weigh in on that, and also recommend some products, too. As who better to consult your teeth than a dentist, right?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“Through the use of different oxygen molecule peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide you can remove stubborn stains from the teeth,” explained <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kevin Sands, DDS</a>. “When the oxygen molecules interact with surface stains they react by breaking apart the chemical bonds that hold the stain to your enamel.”</p><p>Sands is a dentist to the stars, so to speak, with celebrity clients such as Kim Kardashian, Lana Del Rey, Jojo Siwa, Anastasia Karanikolaou, Tyga and more. If you can’t make it out to his Beverly Hills practice however, he did let us in on some favorite products and other helpful tips.</p><p>“For those that wish to whiten their teeth at home, I would recommend you brush your teeth before applying any whiteners to ensure that you are removing any plague from your day and prepping the area properly,” advised Sands.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Lauren Becker, DDS</a>, also weighed in, via email from her practice in Manhattan. Obviously the best results will come from a professional treatment, but there are some tips for getting your pearly whites to stay, well, white.</p><p>“I suggest drinking light or clear liquids so that the stains on the teeth loosen easier. Also avoid acidic beverages like juices, sodas or dark sauces like soy sauce and ketchup,” said Becker. “Instead of whiskey or red wine for alcohol, I recommend that my patients enjoy white wine, vodka or tequila as alternatives. Since I’m a cool dentist and know how to have a good time, instead of cutting out alcohol all together, I suggest options that are lighter in color.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/81b9xm2VvEL._SL1500_.jpg><p>“One product I recommend for an at-home whitening kit is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crest 3D Whitening Strips</a>. These strips are safe to use and will effectively remove 10+ years of stains,” said Sands.</p><p>These are also easy to shop, as they are sold on Amazon and frequently go on sale, saving you a few bucks and taking off years of stains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/81gKiHGUUQL._SL1500_.jpg><p>Another win for Crest, here. Dr. Becker recommends this Amazon find for at-home whitening, making it easy to maintain your smile from home.</p><p>“White strips can be bulky, annoying and require consistency and time while all this requires is the two minutes that you should already be brushing your teeth,” said Becker. “The Step 1 cleanser helps remove plaque while helping prevent sensitivity. Step 2 contains peroxide — the active bleaching agent in any whitening product — and helps whiten and brighten.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/91h92VkHcL._SL1500_.jpg><p>Dr. Becker also recommends this toothpaste as a great one if a whiter smile is what you are after. This one is sold in a pack of four so you won’t run out too quickly, although you should be brushing twice a day — doctor’s orders if you want to maintain that healthy white glow.</p><p>“Teeth whitening varies depending on the patient and how well they maintain their teeth. A fair amount of my patients like to professionally whiten their teeth when they have their cleanings, every six months,” explained Becker.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other top picks for at-home whitening:</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Natural Teeth Whiteners</a>, $200, original price: $549</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-06-01-at-10.17.24-AM.png><p>Combine red and blue light and what do you get?
