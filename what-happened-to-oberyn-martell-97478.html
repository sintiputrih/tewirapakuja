Let’s look at the direct consequences of his death. 1. Tyrion is sentenced to death which leads to him escaping and murdering Shae and Tywin.</p><p>Oh boy. So Oberyn Martell shows up in Episode 1 of Season 4 in Game of Thrones. His back-story maintains that his sister, Elia Martell, was a Princess of Westeros while married to Rhaegar Targaryen, known as “the last dragon”, leading to two children, Aegon and Rhaenys.</p><p>Oberyn as one of the three judges of Tyrion’s trial in “The Laws of Gods and Men”. Oberyn duels Ser Gregor Clegane in “The Mountain and the Viper”. Oberyn brings Gregor to his knees in “The Mountain and the Viper”. Oberyn gets his teeth knocked out by Ser Gregor after being caught off-guard. “May I tell you a secret? You’re not a golden lion.</p><p>So I’m pretty sure even though Tyrion was the one who ultimately killed Tywin, Prince Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper, the master of Poisons, had already sentenced Tywin Lannister to a slow, macabre death. Tyrion actually did Tywin Lannister a favor. Why did Prince Oberyn Martell poison his spear before fighting the Mountain?</p><h2>Why did Oberyn die in Tyrion?</h2><p>Later, Tyene tells her sisters Obara and Nymeria that her mother Ellaria told her that Oberyn died because of<strong> his carelessness.</strong> They are then both killed soon after by Euron Greyjoy.</p><p>Oberyn grows angry with Olyvar when<strong> the prostitute rejects Ellaria’s advances (as he doesn’t have the taste with women), but Ellaria calms him down.</strong> Oberyn then discusses his approach to sexuality (not restricting himself to intimacy with one gender and having as much sex as possible before old age) with Olyvar.</p><p>During a childhood visit to Casterly Rock, Cersei showed Tyrion, with great ceremony, to Oberyn and Elia. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he<strong> saw no monster, just a baby.</strong></p><p>Oberyn is called “the Red Viper” by friend and<strong> foe alike due to his penchant for coating his weapons in lethal poisons,</strong> so that even a glancing wound will prove fatal. Oberyn was the youngest of the three Martell siblings: Elia was born nine years after Doran, and Oberyn one year after Elia.</p><p>He has<strong> eight</strong> bastard daughters, called the Sand Snakes, the four youngest of them by his current paramour, Ellaria Sand . Oberyn has a lined face with thin eyebrows, black “viper” eyes and a sharp nose. His hair is lustrous and black with only a few silver streaks and recedes from his brow into a widow’s peak.</p><p><strong>Season 4.</strong> Oberyn selects prostitutes upon his arrival. Tyrion Lannister meets the lords of Dorne outside King’s Landing, only to find out that Oberyn will be representing House Martell at the king’s wedding, and not his brother, the ruling Prince Doran.</p><p>Oberyn’s face suggests<strong> interest when Tyrion demands trial by combat.</strong> Some days after his demands for a trial by combat, Oberyn visits Tyrion in the dungeons and relates the story of his disappointment in their first encounter.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2>What would happen if Tyrion had defeated Oberyn?</h2><p>1. Tyrion Would (Maybe) Still Be In King’s Landing. If Oberyn had defeated the Mountain, then<strong> Tyrion would have technically been found not guilty of Joffrey’s murder.</strong> That means, he wouldn’t have been sentenced to death and wouldn’t have had to escape King’s Landing. Of course, Cersei would not have been satisfied with that outcome, …</p><p>If Tyrion had stayed in King’s Landing, or didn’t have to flee in the cover of darkness as a fugitive, he may never have gone to Meereen to meet<strong> Daenerys.</strong> Since their alliance is one of the best parts of Game of Thrones currently, that’s at least one good thing that came from Oberyn’s death.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brvBnqmypl2irrPAxKWjZnFnaYR5ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-oberyn-martell-97478.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Oberyn%20Martell%3f%20%20Celebrity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-oberyn-martell-97478.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-oberyn-martell-97478.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Oberyn%20Martell%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-oberyn-martell-97478.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Oberyn%20Martell%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-oberyn-martell-97478.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Oberyn%20Martell%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-oberyn-martell-97478.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Oberyn%20Martell%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cringiest-things-the-chainsmokers-told-billboard-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Chainsmokers Compare Penis Sizes and Other Cringe-y Quotes From Todays Best Hate-Read">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mia-mcgovern-zaini-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-136902-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mia McGovern Zaini Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
