Here’s the lowdown…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wilmer-gets-lindsay-on-that-70s-show>Wilmer Gets Lindsay On ‘That ‘70s Show’</h2><p>It’s amazing what sort of star power comes with being one of the lead actors on a hit TV show — in this case, Valderrama probably didn’t find it hard to get his then-girlfriend a spot on what was one of the hottest sitcoms on television at the time.</p><p>2004 already proved to be a big year for Lohan, who became an overnight sensation following the release of Mean Girls. And while the former redhead certainly had a bright future ahead of her, it’s fair to assume that an appearance on That ‘70s Show had probably helped add to her rising status in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan Auditioned For This Iconic Disney Channel Role</a></span></p><p>Lohan made an appearance in Season 7 on the episode titled ‘Mother’s Little Helper.’ Her character, Danielle, was a client of Fez at the beauty salon, and after being wowed by the shampooing skills, she cancels a planned date to spend time with Fez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While all seemed well between the two while filming That ‘70s Show, it was later revealed that Lohan’s character was cut out from the rest of the series because LiLo was said to have been recovering from exhaustion and high fever after being hospitalized in October 2004.</p><p>Several publications reported that the Herbie: Fully Loaded star needed a break by the year’s end to deal with emotional and physical issues, and continuing on in a relationship with Valderrama just wasn’t in her future.</p><p>It wasn’t long after that when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lohan and Valderrama decided to go their separate ways</a>, but both parties were determined to remain close friends moving forward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What We Know About Lindsay Lohan And Her Strange Teeth</a></span></p><p>2005 proved to be another successful year for Lohan, who negotiated a $7.5 million deal to star as Maggie Peyton in 2005’s Herbie: Fully Loaded, which was a huge salary spike in contrast to the $1 million she made from Mean Girls the year prior.</p><p>In 2006, the 35-year-old had another good year when she a second deal worth $7.5 million to appear opposite Chris Pine in the comedy flick, Just My Luck, showing clear signs that Lohan’s career was on the rise — and it was moving rapidly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But that same year, she started making some controversial headlines; this included everything from stumbling out of the nightclubs all too often to multiple run-ins with the law for things such as drunk driving, which was something LiLo had gotten in trouble for one too many times over the years.</p><p>Lohan told Piers Morgan in 2013 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the year 2007 must have been one of her most troubling years</a>&nbsp;when she was convicted twice of drunken driving and once for cocaine use before making three individual trips to rehab and serving 84 minutes behind bars.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan Rejected A Role That Could’ve Resurrected Her Career</a></span></p><p>She notes that 2007 really changed her life and the public’s perception of who they thought Lohan was.</p><p>"And from then on, the press were on me all the time,” she said. "It was the first time I'd taken drugs. I was out in a club with people I shouldn't have been with, and took cocaine, and got in the car. It was so stupid.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While filming her movie, I Know Who Killed Me, that same year, she checked herself into rehab, leading her to have some frightening nightmares.</p><p>"So I stayed in a facility so I could get some sleep and talk about it with someone the next day, because it was overwhelming. But I would leave every day and just sleep there at night. I liked that. It was kind of like having my own live-in therapist, because I was having crazy nightmares and I was having AA meetings on set and stuff. It really helped.”</p><p>Lohan and Valderrama aren’t believed to be on speaking terms anymore.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan And The Men And Women She’s Been Linked To</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoqSdmr9uwsClm56qopa6onnDoptmrJiewG6yzqtkpaGemcCixYylpqGZnmLEqbXLnmStoJWuerix0Z5knZmknruoew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwilmer-valderrama-did-this-for-lindsay-lohan-while-they-were-dating.html&text=Wilmer%20Valderrama%20Did%20This%20For%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20While%20They%20Were%20Dating&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwilmer-valderrama-did-this-for-lindsay-lohan-while-they-were-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwilmer-valderrama-did-this-for-lindsay-lohan-while-they-were-dating.html&title=Wilmer%20Valderrama%20Did%20This%20For%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20While%20They%20Were%20Dating" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwilmer-valderrama-did-this-for-lindsay-lohan-while-they-were-dating.html&title=Wilmer%20Valderrama%20Did%20This%20For%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20While%20They%20Were%20Dating" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwilmer-valderrama-did-this-for-lindsay-lohan-while-they-were-dating.html&title=Wilmer%20Valderrama%20Did%20This%20For%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20While%20They%20Were%20Dating" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwilmer-valderrama-did-this-for-lindsay-lohan-while-they-were-dating.html&description=Wilmer%20Valderrama%20Did%20This%20For%20Lindsay%20Lohan%20While%20They%20Were%20Dating" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rhom-star-lisa-hochstein-shades-her-ex-in-new-year-post-as-she-steps-out-with-rumored-beau-in-miami.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'RHOM' star Lisa Hochstein shades ex Lenny as she steps out with rumored beau Jody Glidden">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-kevin-bieksa-kids-details-to-know-about-the-family-of-the-ice-hockey-defenceman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Kevin Bieksa Kids?
