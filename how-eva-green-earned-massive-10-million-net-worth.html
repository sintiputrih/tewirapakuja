Her distinctive looks and ability to turn her hand to almost any kind of role has made her one of the biggest names in Hollywood right now; from witches, to Bond girls, to schoolmistresses - she's played them all. Green first made her name acting on stage, something she excelled at, before transitioning to the screen in 2003 when she appeared in The Dreamers. Fans may know her best from her turn as Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale. Green has also had top billing in a string of big movies and TV shows, making her a household name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Eva Green Really Feels About Being In So Many NSFW Scenes">How Eva Green Really Feels About Being In So Many NSFW Scenes</a></span></p><p>After acting in movies for over twenty years, Eva has surely established herself in terms of demanding high fees for her acting roles. But how much is the notoriously secretive actress worth? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=eva-green-started-her-career-in-theatre><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Eva Green Started Her Career In Theatre</span></h2><p>After spending time at university, Green eventually decided on an acting career and launched herself into it with the support of her mother, taking up an acting course while living in London. Green liked how acting allowed her to process her feelings and escape herself. She began auditioning everywhere, and eventually landed herself some stage roles in France. During the early 2000s, Eva appeared in several shows, to good reviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-then-transitioned-into-screen-roles><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Then Transitioned Into Screen Roles</span></h2><p>Green made the move into movies around 2003, when she<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> secured her breakthrough role in </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dreamers.</a> The movie really tested Green - biting, violent, and explicitly sexual, it was everything she was wasn't and really pushed her to her artistic limits. The graphic sex scenes in the movie were a concern for her, and she worried that appearing in the film might have threatened her career and deeply upset her family. Fortunately, Eva escaped being type-cast in similar roles, and was able to further her career off the back of its huge success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-movies-has-eva-been-in><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Movies Has Eva Been In?</span></h2><p>Green continued to find mainstream success<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> in a number of big movies. </a>Her biggest - and the one which made her a household name - was Casino Royale in 2006, where she played bond girl Vesper Lynd - a serious love interest of the spy.
