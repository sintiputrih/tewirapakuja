This is due to the game launching at the same time across the globe.</p><h2>New Zealand Region trick on Xbox to play games EARLY!</h2><h2>Does Xbox New Zealand trick work?</h2><p>No, unfortunately, the New Zealand trick will not work with Like a Dragon Gaiden. This is because it has a global release date, meaning it comes out at the same time everywhere.

So, if you have an Xbox console, go ahead and use the New Zealand glitch to get a head start on playing EA FC 24!</p><h2>Will New Zealand trick work for AC Mirage?</h2><p>The New Zealand trick does work for Assassin’s Creed Mirage.</p><p>Therefore, players can change their console region to New Zealand to trick their system into allowing them to play the game earlier.

Conversely, the Extra mode for Texture Resolution doesn’t upscale anything, it’ll just make MW3’s surfaces look better.</p><h2>What time does New Zealand get MW3?</h2><p>Modern Warfare 3 Console Release Time</p><p>This means that the game launches at 12AM in your respective time zone. So players in New Zealand will be the first to receive the game, while everyone else will have to wait until 12AM in their country.</p><h2>Is Assassin’s Creed Mirage in Egypt?</h2><p>The setting of the new game, “Assassin’s Creed Mirage,” is perhaps not as present in current pop culture: The action takes place in Baghdad in the 9th century.</p><h2>What country will Assassin’s Creed Mirage be in?</h2><p>With its 13th instalment released on Thursday, Assassin’s Creed Mirage attempts to immerse players in Iraq’s 9th-century Baghdad during the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate, when it was one of the most significant cities in the world.</p><h2>Will there be modern day in AC Mirage?</h2><p>Mirage is the first mainline game in the series to feature no modern-day sections at all, and it’s all the better for it.</p><h2>How do I make my Xbox think I am in New Zealand?</h2><p>On your Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S</p><li>Sign in to your Xbox console.</li><li>Press the Xbox button  to open the guide.</li><li>Select Profile & system > Settings > System > Language & location.</li><li>Select your new country or region from the drop-down list under Location.</li><h2>Can you do New Zealand trick for Warzone 2?</h2><p>Can you do New Zealand trick for Warzone 2?
