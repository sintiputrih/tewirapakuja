But even in these supposedly welcoming conversations, too much of fashion will do what it always does: focus on thin, conventionally attractive, cis-gender white people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finding on-trend clothing for fat bodies is challenging, even though the average woman in the United States wears a size 16/18 and the plus-size market garnered a reported $480 billion<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> in 2019</a>. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the lack of size-inclusivity in gender-neutral fashion. As this form of expression gains more popularity, brands such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Telfar</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Norma Kamali</a>, Equipment, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Wildfang</a> have released gender-neutral pieces. And while some are offered up to a size XXL, the vast majority of gender-neutral fashion is made (and marketed as) for thin bodies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Besides my chagrin at yet another "trend" <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>we're not allowed to participate in because we're fat</a>, I also wonder how non-binary or masculine-presenting people with fat bodies feel and how they find ways to express their gender through their clothing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have complex gender feelings," shares Australian musician <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kira Puru</a>, who identifies as non-binary. "Sometimes I wake up in the morning to get ready and pick up a dress, and it's like, 'Nah, not today.'" Puru's tone about how she chooses to dress may seem lighthearted, but clothing can be affirming to the non-binary experience, which is more important than she lets on at first. Puru, who is Māori, only recently started talking publicly about being non-binary, but her on-stage and off-stage looks have been bucking societal gender norms since she started releasing her addictive electro-pop tunes in 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ellen Kempner, of the Boston band Palehound, recognizes these challenges as a non-binary, plus-size artist. "It's hard for me to find inspiration for myself when I just don't have access to most of the clothes that people do," she says, pointing to fellow rocker the former <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Alabama Shakes singer Brittany Howard</a> as someone who's managed to transcend the market's limited view. "She's so stylish and also androgynous, which is rare for plus-size people because our bodies are so feminized, because we have big tits and hips. To see someone with a similar body to mine pulling off this sick, powerful, androgynous look," Kempner adds. "She gives me so much hope."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In order to pull off that kind of look, though, fat androgynous or gender-nonconforming people are forced to get creative. "I'm honestly usually in the men's section," diversity and inclusion consultant and plus-size fashion influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jazzmyne Jay</a> says. Similarly, Puru says she had to become her own fashion designer. "I got really good at customizing clothing and cutting things up and adjusting them to fit my body." Why, at this stage, we still need to DIY our clothing is a mystery only fashion itself can solve. However, I have a few working theories about why we don't see a wider selection of gender-neutral clothing for fat bodies (hint: it's fatphobia. It's always fatphobia).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So much plus-size fashion seems to be hyper-performing femininity; the excessive floral prints, curve-hugging bodycons, and ever-present peplums drawing attention to the waist. For women of a certain size, this often serves as a protective shield, since some are denied femininity, a sentiment echoed in author and professor Roxanne Gay's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2017 memoir, Hunger</a>: "We have such narrow ideas about femininity," Gay writes. "When you are very tall and wide... you all too often present as 'not woman.'" Meanwhile, the pervasive stereotype that fat people are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>inherently lazy</a> makes more loose-fitting, gender-neutral silhouettes seem almost forbidden (I'm reminded of Karl Lagerfeld's infamous quote: "sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life, so you bought some sweatpants").</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course on the opposite end of the spectrum, so-called "curvy" fat bodies are seen as inherently feminine, and fashion seems hard-pressed to see them as more than that. Fat people fit neatly into a box, denied the opportunity of exploration — not only due to lack of availability, but because of fear of ridicule. So it often happens that fat people dress for others' expectations and comfort rather than our own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Puru, those expectations don't figure into her gender or her clothing choices, "what's available [in fashion] doesn't work for me, it's not exciting. It doesn't fit me. I think that is very in line with the non-binary experience because gendered fashion doesn't work for me because I don't have a boxed-in gender."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because that's the point: people don't stop desiring self-expression because they don't fit a size 12, but that's what fashion presumes when it simply doesn't offer a variety of styles in large sizes. "[Expression through fashion] is the most important thing to me," Jay shares. "If you take that away from me, I am NOT okay." And her Instagram feed perfectly illustrates that. From <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>feminine red dresses</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>stereotypically masculine streetwear</a>, Jay's vibrant, queer, fluid personality, like Puru's, doesn't fit into one box, and her style is a necessary tool for expressing that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For others facing this retail struggle, thankfully, the market isn't completely barren; there's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Big Bud Press</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Universal Standard</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Nordstrom x Wildfang's recently released collab</a>, British high street brand <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Asos' Collusion</a>, and a few others. Jay models an Ivy Park outfit in the Instagram post above, which she specifically compliments for its size range. The needle moves, but for an industry that prides itself on always looking ahead, that needle sure seems to be moving pretty slowly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's a larger conversation here about fashion's lack of interest in fat bodies, and another one about how society continues to willfully misunderstand non-binary and gender-fluid experiences. I won't claim to be the voice to speak to either, but here's what I will say: Your body and how you choose to present is totally up to you, and no matter what that looks like it's valid. Now, if brands aren't coming to the table with interesting clothing that fits? That's their loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With additional reporting by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jael Goldfine</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2S9rcHSZqqispVitKa6w56pZqaVqsGzrctmqq2xnJo%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fplus-size-gender-neutral-style.html&text=Plus%20Size%20Gender%20Neutral%20Clothing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fplus-size-gender-neutral-style.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fplus-size-gender-neutral-style.html&title=Plus%20Size%20Gender%20Neutral%20Clothing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fplus-size-gender-neutral-style.html&title=Plus%20Size%20Gender%20Neutral%20Clothing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fplus-size-gender-neutral-style.html&title=Plus%20Size%20Gender%20Neutral%20Clothing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fplus-size-gender-neutral-style.html&description=Plus%20Size%20Gender%20Neutral%20Clothing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shaquil-barrett-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shaquil Barrett Wife, Who Is Jordanna Barrett?
