Some of the most powerful people in the world have at one point or another held this distinction ‚Äî including Bill Gates, <a href=#><u>Mark Zuckerberg</u></a>, and <a href=#>Elon Musk</a>.</p><p>Who else held the title? One person is reality star turned beauty mogul <a href=# style=text-align:start>Kylie Jenner</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, that claim was being hotly contested by Forbes magazine ‚Äî the same publication that first announced Kylie was a "self-made billionaire." So, is Kylie really a billionaire? Let's explore her net worth and find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@kyliejenner</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Forbes' said Kylie wasn't an "actual" billionaire. Here's how she responded.</h2><p>The financial publication indicated that Kylie has been engaged in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"web of lies"</a> surrounding her claim as the world's youngest self-made billionaire. The outlet suggested that she was able to provide "proof" of her claim with falsified tax documents, something that the cosmetics mogul and social media star categorically denied in a tweet storm.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>what am i even waking up to. i thought this was a reputable site.. all i see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. i‚Äôve never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. period</p>‚Äî Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) <a href=#>May 29, 2020</a></figure><p>Forbes declared that Kylie was the youngest self-made billionaire after she made a deal with Coty, which was valued at $1.2 billion back in January 2020.</p><p>However, when folks started delving into the fine print of the acquisition, they noticed that Kylie Cosmetics is much smaller and way less profitable than the initial figures indicated.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>but okay ü§ç i am blessed beyond my years, i have a beautiful daughter, and a successful business and i‚Äôm doing perfectly fine.</p>‚Äî Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) <a href=#>May 29, 2020</a></figure><p>The article includes some scathing words for Kylie and her family, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>. "The unusual lengths to which the Jenners have been willing to go ‚Äî including inviting Forbes into their mansions and CPA‚Äôs offices, and even creating tax returns that were likely forged ‚Äî reveals just how desperate some of the ultra-rich are to look even richer," the article read.</p><p>It continued, "'It‚Äôs fair to say that everything the Kardashian-Jenner family does is oversized,' says Stephanie Wissink, an equity analyst covering consumer products at Jefferies. 'To stay on-brand, it needs to be bigger than it is.'"</p><p>"A more realistic accounting of her personal fortune puts it at just under $900 million, despite the headlines surrounding the Coty deal that seemed to confirm her billionaire status." So, where does Kylie's net worth really stand?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>wow. i can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition.

Kylie's net worth currently stands at $750 million if you ask <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, but may actually be a bit lower. According to Forbes‚Äôs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 list</a> of America‚Äôs Richest Self-Made Women, Kylie lands at the 38th spot, with a net worth of $680 million.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Kylie Jenner</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Founder of Kylie Cosmetics</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $680 million</p><p>Kylie Jenner rose to fame thanks to her role on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Following in her sister's footsteps, she made a name for herself and established a now thriving business, Kylie Cosmetics.</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> Aug. 10, 1997</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Los Angeles, Calif.</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Graduated from Laurel Springs School</p><p><strong>Kids:</strong> 2 (with Travis Scott)</p><p><strong>Relationship Status: </strong>Dating Timothy Chalamet</p><p><strong>Parents:</strong> Caitlyn Jenner (formerly known as Bruce Jenner) and Kris Jenner</p><p>Regardless, there has been a ton of debate on social media over the past few years about whether or not ‚Äúself-made‚Äù is truly an accurate description of Kylie. While her main product line, <a href=#>Kylie Cosmetics</a>, bears her name, it‚Äôs not like she does everything in the production process.</p><p>On top of that, she has certainly benefited just from being a member of the most prominent family in American culture.</p><p>The Kardashian-Jenner clan is completely omnipotent on TV and social media, and who‚Äôs to say if Kylie would be anywhere without the built-in name recognition? While there are hundreds of other arguments you could make to discredit Kylie, there are some key factors you can‚Äôt ignore, and they give a bit of justification to her "self-made" moniker.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fact: Kylie Jenner started Kylie Cosmetics with her own money.</h2><p>Kylie has claimed that she started the Kylie Cosmetics empire ‚Äî she sold her very first Lip Kit in 2015 ‚Äî using only her own hard-earned money. That would definitely help qualify as a self-made business and could put a lot of arguments to rest.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>They are now officially sold out!

By marketing herself properly and becoming a social-media-influencer extraordinaire, launching a brand of physical products became almost a no-risk operation with very little chance to fail.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>. <a href=#>@KylieJenner</a> wearing ‚Äúan apple a day‚Äù matte lipstick üíÑ now available on <a href=#>https://t.co/rkT2b8sGJ5</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ckRWRJRhh7</a></p>‚Äî Kylie Cosmetics (@kyliecosmetics) <a href=#>April 26, 2023</a></figure><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 Forbes profile</a> on Kylie‚Äôs newfound billionaire-status, she‚Äôs quoted saying, "It‚Äôs the power of social media. I had such a strong reach before I was able to start anything."</p><p>Though the brand was driven and created in part by Kylie's mother <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a><a href=#>,</a> it‚Äôs no question that Kylie is 100 percent the driving force behind the success of Kylie Cosmetics.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kylie Jenner is one smart businesswoman.</h2><p>The decision to partner with <a href=#>Ulta Beauty and sell Kylie Lip Kits</a> exclusively in their stores turned out to be one of the most lucrative moves possible, selling $54 million worth of products in the first six weeks of the partnership.</p><p>The revenue has climbed every year since, and the recent valuations of Kylie Cosmetics have it worth upwards of $1.2 billion ... that is, until Forbes did a reassessment of Kylie's finances. And although she <a href=#>sold 51 percent of her stake in the company to Coty Inc</a> in 2019, which netted her a nice $340 million, Kylie still acts as the public face of the brand.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kylie Jenner's wealth is not just because of her makeup.</h2><p>Outside of Kylie Cosmetics, Kylie has a variety of other income sources to push her into billionaire status. Brand endorsements galore, <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>, and a multitude of other business ventures keep her busy and help to line her pockets even further.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>glow on the go <a href=#>@drinkglow</a> <a href=#>#glowpartner</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nJ0ARXnmJG</a></p>‚Äî Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) <a href=#>May 30, 2023</a></figure><p>While the self-made title could still be endlessly debated, there's no doubt that Kylie has made efforts to forge her own path despite her privileged background and built-in success.</p><p>So no, Kylie isn't a billionaire, but her net worth is reportedly around $680 million, which is still a lot of money.
