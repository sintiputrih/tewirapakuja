He started pimping at 16 years old, using his record store as a front for his activities in the 1970s. He retired from pimping in 1985, claiming divine intervention and becoming a minister.</p><p>After meeting Snoop Dogg backstage at a concert, Juan became friends with the rapper and served as his “spiritual adviser.” He has since become a mainstream figure, appearing in rap shows, music videos, TV programs, and films with popular rappers like 50 Cent and Da Brat.</p><h2><span id=Bishop_Don_Magic_Juans_Early_Life>Bishop Don “Magic” Juan’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Born in Chicago, Illinois on November 30, 1950, Bishop Don “Magic” Juan was raised by both his parents alongside his sister. His father, who lacked proper education, became a successful businessman and entrepreneur, instilling his entrepreneurial spirit in Juan. However, Juan initially used this spirit for illegal activities, starting his career in pimping.</p><h2><span id=Don_Magic_Juans_Early_Life_and_Career>Don “Magic” Juan’s Early Life and Career</span></h2><p>Don “Magic” Juan, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, got involved with pimping at the age of 16 in Chicago. He learned from successful pimps and read the books of Iceberg Slim, who had formerly been a pimp before becoming a writer. In the 1970s, he operated a record store in Chicago that also served as a way for him to recruit prostitutes. He began going by the name Don “Magic” Juan and living a lavish lifestyle that involved many women, alcohol, and drug use.</p><h2><span id=Don_Magic_Juans_Spiritual_Transformation>Don “Magic” Juan’s Spiritual Transformation</span></h2><p>Don “Magic” Juan was a notorious pimp and drug dealer in Chicago during the 1970s and 1980s. However, in 1985, he had a spiritual experience while smoking PCP and dedicated his life to serving God.</p><p>He was later ordained as a minister by Dr. F. L. Johnson of the Christian Ministers Congress Non-Denominational Council, Inc after studying for a few years at the Moody Bible Institute. In 1989, he opened the Magic World Christian Kingdom Church of the Royal Family.</p><p>While working as a minister, Campbell still maintained his flashy lifestyle and would wear fancy clothing, jewelry, and drive nice cars. In 1993, he decided to close the church in order to focus on working in the field as a minister of God. In 1994, he published an autobiography called “From Pimp Stick to Pulpit: The Life Story of Don ‘Magic’ Juan.”</p><h2><span id=Bishop_Don_Magic_Juans_Career_in_Show_Business>Bishop Don “Magic” Juan’s Career in Show Business</span></h2><p>By 2000, Bishop Don “Magic” Juan had moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in show business after appearing as himself in the documentary film “American Pimp.” He became friends with rapper Snoop Dogg and acted as his spiritual advisor, which helped him land various guest appearances in films, television series, and music videos. Some of his notable appearances include “Friday After Next,” “The Boondocks,” “Behind the Music,” “Girls Next Door,” and “Pimps Up, Ho’s Down.” He also released a compilation album of soul classics called “Green is for the Money, Gold is for the Honeys” in 2006 and was featured on Snoop Dogg’s album “Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss.” Throughout his time in show business, he has kept the name Bishop Don “Magic” Juan.</p><h2><span id=Campbells_Personal_Life>Campbell’s Personal Life</span></h2><p>Not much is known about Campbell’s personal life. Any marriages he has been involved in over the course of his life have not been made public and he does not have any known children.</p><p>He splits his time between Los Angeles and Chicago when he is not otherwise traveling for work.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCuyKyfqKhdmbyvecyanqKbXZ%2FCorqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbishop-don-magic-juan-net-worth.html&text=Bishop%20Don%20Magic%20Juan%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbishop-don-magic-juan-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbishop-don-magic-juan-net-worth.html&title=Bishop%20Don%20Magic%20Juan%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbishop-don-magic-juan-net-worth.html&title=Bishop%20Don%20Magic%20Juan%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbishop-don-magic-juan-net-worth.html&title=Bishop%20Don%20Magic%20Juan%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbishop-don-magic-juan-net-worth.html&description=Bishop%20Don%20Magic%20Juan%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./blue-lock-chapter-207-spoiler-release-date-plot-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blue Lock Chapter 207 Spoiler, Release Date, Plot Explained">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-is-alex-rodriguez-not-in-the-hall-of-fame.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why is Alex Rodriguez not in the Hall of Fame?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
