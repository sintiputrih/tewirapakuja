It was supposed to be a six-episode series but now has been scrapped to five.</p><p>While the news of The Idol was buzzing, it has been rumored that Euphoria will also be canceled. When Euphoria was first released in 2019, it was critically acclaimed.</p><p>Many cast members won a lot of awards, like <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/zendaya/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya</a> bagging two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Critics’ Choice Television Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>But with Season 2, the storyline significantly downgraded. Moreover, cast members like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie Ferriera</a> complained about Levinson.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, it has been rumored that Euphoria will be canceled after Season 3. This rumor originated from DeuxMoi and has been discussed on Reddit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is ‘Euphoria’ canceled after Season 3?</h2><p>Recently, DeuxMoi received a message from an anonymous source named ‘Madz Perez’ who claimed that Euphoria would not have a Season 4. They texted about DeuxMoi discussing Euphoria being canceled and confirmed that it was “100% true.”</p><p>They noted that Levinson and one of his producing partners were in “deep trouble” with HBO and Warner Bros for violating and breaking protocols while working on Euphoria and The Idol. They did not reveal what protocols Levinson had violated but said that the heads of HBO knew about it.</p><p>They did not say anything at first because Levinson had made a lot of money for HBO. However, it is not the same case anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Euphoria-Is-Reportedly-Getting-Canceled-By-HBO.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">DeuxMoi revealed that Euphoria might be canceled after Season 3.

This would mean that Levinson will no longer get to work on Euphoria, hence the show would never have a Season 4.</p><p>Fans and followers of the show are not surprised by the rumor. They discussed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> how the rumors were very likely to happen, especially after the public reaction to The Idol.</p><p>One Redditor noted, “This just seems like a good guess with the writers’ strike and The Idol situation. The cast will be like 40 by the time they film and some of them have big projects coming up.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Some netizens pointed out that the show getting canceled was inevitable because of how bad <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2</a> was. One of them wrote, “Honestly… season two had gaping plot holes and the last episode did little to remedy them. The characters, especially Kat and Jules, were tossed aside and treated very poorly.”</p><p>“I’m unsure what Sam Levinsons beef is with those two, but they acted out of character, to say the least. And don’t get me started on the Laurie situation and how frustrating that dilemma is,” they concluded.</p><p>However, many were still hopeful that HBO would not cancel Euphoria. They commented how the show was huge and had a mass appeal amongst Gen Z.</p><p>As a result, HBO would not make the mistake of canceling the show. A Redditor commented, “HBO would never drop Euphoria as a brand for Sam Levinson. They’d just replace him and keep the show going.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I need the people closest to Sam Levinson to stage an intervention where they explain that narrative works of fiction require a premise, rising action, climax, falling action, and conclusion.

They could go the Skins route and people would watch it.”</p><p>At the time of writing, neither HBO nor Levinson has released any news about the cancellation of Euphoria after Season 3.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What we know about ‘Euphoria’ Season 3</h2><p>A month after Season 2 was released in January 2022, Euphoria was renewed for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Season 3</a>.</p><p>The show’s makers have not announced any release dates, but they were rumored to have begun production in 2023.

Most of the cast members are returning for Season 3, with the exception of Ferriera, who played the role of Katherine “Kat” Hernandez.</p><p>The plot and details of Season 3 are yet to be announced. However, Heidi Bivens, Euphoria’s costume designer, revealed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vogue</a> that it is set “approximately five years in the future” when the characters are out of high school.</p><p class=has-small-font-size><strong>Follow Glamour Buff on </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Google News</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Teenage Rapper Lil Purk to Serve 20 Years in Prison for Atlantic Station Double Murder</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Lil Purk has been jailed 20 years in prison.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lil-Purk-Arrested.jpg alt="Teenage Rapper Lil Purk to Serve 20 Years in Prison for Atlantic Station Double Murder" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Teenage Rapper Lil Purk, real name Antonio Jackson, has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">jailed</a> for 20 years in prison for a deadly shooting near Atlantic Station in November 2022.</p><p>Five of the six defendants, Lil Purk, Demetrius Hill, Toney Wilson, Deandre Forston, and DeRodney Russell, entered negotiated guilty pleas, their sentences ranging from 20 to 40 years.&nbsp;</p><p>The rapper was sentenced to 20 years, with 10 years to be served in custody and 10 years on probation.
