He was 27 years old and at his boxing peak physically and mentally, Ali, 29, was coming back from a three-year absence but had kept active. He had had two good wins, including a bruising battle with Oscar Bonavena, whom Ali had defeated by a TKO in 15 rounds. Frazier worked on strategy with coach Eddie Futch. They noted Ali's tendency to throw a right-hand uppercut from a straight standing position after dropping the hand in preparation to throw it with force. Futch instructed Frazier to watch Ali's right hand and, at the moment Ali dropped it, to throw a left hook at the spot where they knew Ali's face would be a second later. Frazier staggered Ali in the 11th round and knocked down Ali in the 15th in this way.</p><span>1950</span><p>In the early 1950s, Frazier's father bought a black and white television. The family and others nearby came to watch boxing matches on it. Frazier's mother sold drinks for a quarter as they watched boxers like <a href=#>Sugar Ray</a> Robinson, Rocky Marciano, Willie Pep and Rocky Graziano. One night Frazier's Uncle <a href=#>Israel</a> noticed his stocky build. "That boy there...that boy is gonna be another Joe Louis" he remarked. The words made an impression on Joe. His classmates at school would give him a sandwich or a quarter to walk with them at final bell so that bullies would not bother them. Frazier said, "Any 'scamboogah' (a disrespectful, low-down and foul person) who got in my face would soon regret it; Billie Boy could kick anybody's ass." The day after his Uncle's comment, Frazier filled old burlap sack with rags, corncobs, a brick, and <a href=#>Spanish</a> moss. He hung the makeshift heavybag from an oak tree in the backyard. "For the next 6, 7 years, damn near every day I'd hit that heavybag for an hour at a time. I'd wrap my hands with a necktie of my Daddy's, or a stocking of my Momma's or sister's, and get to it" Joe remarked.</p><span>1958</span><p>The train fare from Beaufort to the cities up North was costly, and the closest bus-stop was in Charleston, 75 miles (121&nbsp;km) away. Luckily by 1958, the bus (The Dog, as called by locals in Beaufort) had finally made Beaufort a stop on its South Carolina route. Joe had a brother, Tommy, in New York. He was told he could stay with Tommy and his family. Joe had to save up a bit before he could make the bus trip to New York and still have some money in his pocket, and so first he went to work at the local Coca-Cola plant. Joe remarked that the white guy would drive the truck and he would do the real work, stacking and unloading the crates. Joe stayed with Coca-Cola until the government began building houses for the Marines stationed at Parris Island, at which time he was hired on a work crew.</p><span>1959</span><p>Nine months eventually passed since he got the boot from the Bellamy farm. One day, with no fanfare, no tearful goodbyes, Joe packed quickly and got the first bus heading northward. He finally settled in Philadelphia, "I climbed on the Dog's back and rode through the night" Joe remarked. "It was 1959, I was 15 years old and I was on my own."</p><span>1960</span><p>Frazier emerged as the top contender in the late 1960s, defeating opponents that included Jerry Quarry, Oscar Bonavena, Buster Mathis, Eddie Machen, Doug Jones, George Chuvalo, and Jimmy Ellis en route to becoming undisputed heavyweight champion in 1970, and followed up by defeating Muhammad Ali by unanimous decision in the highly anticipated Fight of the Century in 1971. Two years later, Frazier lost his title when he was defeated by George Foreman. He fought on, beating Joe Bugner, losing a rematch to Ali and beating Quarry and Ellis again.</p><span>1962</span><p>During Frazier's amateur career, he won Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championships in 1962, 1963 and 1964. His only loss in three years as an amateur was to Buster Mathis. Mathis would prove to be Joe's biggest obstacle to making the 1964 U.S. Olympic Boxing team. They met in the final of the U.S. Olympic Trial at the New York World's Fair in the summer of 1964. Their fight was scheduled for three rounds and they fought with 10&nbsp;oz gloves and with headgear, even though the boxers who made it to Tokyo would wear no headgear and would wear 8&nbsp;oz gloves. Joe was eager to get back at Mathis for his only amateur loss and KO'd two opponents to get to the finals. But once again, when the dust settled, the judges had called it for Mathis, undeservedly Joe thought. "All that fat boy had done was run like a thief- hit me with a peck and backpedal like crazy." Joe would remark.</p><span>1964</span><p>After Frazier won the USA's only 1964 Olympic boxing gold medal, his trainer Yancey "Yank" Durham helped put together Cloverlay, a group of local businessmen (including a young Larry Merchant) who invested in Frazier's professional career and allowed him to train full-time. Durham was Frazier's chief trainer and manager until Durham's death in August 1973.</p><span>1965</span><p>Frazier turned professional in 1965, defeating Woody Goss by a technical knockout in the first round. He won three more fights that year, all by knockout, none going past the third round. Later that year, he was in a training accident, where he suffered an injury which left him legally blind in his left eye. During pre-fight physicals, after reading the eye chart with his right eye, when prompted to cover his other eye, Frazier switched hands, but covered his left eye for a second time, and state athletic commission <a href=#>Physicians</a> seemed to not notice or act.</p><span>1966</span><p>Now in his second year, in September 1966 and somewhat green, Frazier won a close decision over rugged contender Oscar Bonavena, despite Bonavena flooring him twice in the second round. A third knockdown in that round would have ended the fight under the three knockdown rule. Frazier rallied and won a decision after 12 rounds. The Machen win followed this contest.</p><span>1967</span><p>By February 1967 Joe had scored 14 wins and his star was beginning to rise. This culminated with his first appearance on the cover of <i>Ring Magazine</i>. In this month he met Ali, who hadn't yet been stripped of his title. Ali said Joe would never stand a chance of "whipping" him, not even in his wildest dreams. Later that year, Muhammad Ali was stripped of his world heavyweight title due to his refusal to be inducted into the military during the <a href=#>Vietnam</a> War.</p><span>1968</span><p>He closed 1968 by again beating Oscar Bonavena via a 15-round decision in a hard-fought rematch. Bonavena fought somewhat defensively, allowing himself to be often bulled to the ropes, which let Frazier build a wide points margin. <i>Ring Magazine</i> showed Bonavena afterwards with a gruesomely bruised face. It had been a punishing match.</p><span>1969</span><p>1969 saw Frazier defend his NYSAC title in Texas, beating Dave Zyglewicz, who'd only lost once in 29 fights, by a first-round knockout. Then he beat Jerry Quarry in a 7th round stoppage. The competitive, exciting match with Quarry was named 1969 <i>Ring Magazine</i> fight of the year. Frazier showed he could do a lot more than just slug. He'd used his newly honed defensive skills to slip, bob and weave a barrage of Quarry punches despite Quarry's reputation as an excellent counter punching heavyweight.</p><span>1970</span><p>In the late 1970s, Frazier created a soul-funk group called "Joe Frazier and the Knockouts," mentioned in Billboard and recording a number of singles. Joe toured widely all over the USA and Europe including <a href=#>Ireland</a> where among other places he performed in Donegal and Athy County Kildare, <a href=#>Ireland</a> with his band. Joe Frazier and the Knockouts were also featured singing in a 1978 Miller beer commercial.</p><span>1971</span><p>On March 8, 1971, at <a href=#>Madison</a> Square Garden, Frazier and Ali met in the first of their three bouts which was called the "Fight of the Century" in pre-bout publicity and by the press. With an international television audience and an in-house audience that included luminaries Frank Sinatra (as a <a href=#>Photographer</a> for <i>Life</i> magazine to get a ringside seat), <a href=#>Comedian</a> Woody Allen, singer Diana Ross and actors Dustin Hoffman and Burt Lancaster (who served as "color commentator" with fight announcer Don Dunphy), the two undefeated heavyweights met in a media-frenzied atmosphere reminiscent of Joe Louis' youth.</p><span>1972</span><p>In 1972, Frazier successfully defended the title twice, beating Terry Daniels and Ron Stander, both by knockout, in the fourth and fifth rounds respectively. Daniels had earlier drawn with Jerry Quarry and Stander had knocked out Earnie Shavers.</p><span>1973</span><p>His daughter Jackie Frazier-Lyde is a <a href=#>Lawyer</a> and worked on her father's behalf in pursuit of money they claimed he was owed in a <a href=#>Pennsylvania</a> land deal. In 1973, Frazier purchased 140 acres in Bucks County, <a href=#>Pennsylvania</a> for $843,000. Five years later, a developer agreed to buy the farmland for $1.8 million. Frazier received annual payments from a trust that bought the land with money he had earned in the ring. However, when the trust went bankrupt, the payments ceased.</p><span>1974</span><p>During a televised joint interview prior to their second bout in 1974, Ali continued to insult Frazier, who took exception to Ali calling him "ignorant" and challenged him to a fight, which resulted in the two of them brawling on the studio floor. Ali went on to win the 12 round non-title affair by a decision. Ali took things further in the build-up to their last fight, The Thrilla in Manila, and called Frazier "the other type of negro" and "ugly", "dumb" and a "gorilla" At one point he sparred with a man in a gorilla suit and pounded on a rubber gorilla doll, saying "This is Joe Frazier's conscience... I keep it everywhere I go. This is the way he looks when you hit him." According to the fight's promoter Don King, this enraged Frazier, who took it as a "character assassination" and "personal invective". One night before the fight, Ali waved around a toy pistol outside Frazier's hotel room. When Frazier came to the balcony, he pointed the gun at Frazier and yelled "I am going to shoot you." After the fight, Ali summoned Frazier's son Marvis into his dressing room, and told him that he had not meant what he had said about his father. When informed of this by Marvis, Frazier responded: "you ain't me, son. Why isn't he apologizing to me?"</p><span>1975</span><p>Ali and Frazier met for the third and final time in Quezon City (a district within the metropolitan area of Manila), the <a href=#>Philippines</a>, on October 1, 1975: the "Thrilla in Manila". Prior to the fight, Ali took opportunities to mock Frazier by calling him a '"gorilla", and generally trying to irritate him.</p><span>1976</span><p>Frazier made a cameo appearance in the movie <i>Rocky</i> later in 1976 and dedicated himself to training local boxers in Philadelphia, where he grew up, including some of his own children. He also helped train Duane Bobick.</p><span>1977</span><p>The fight was a punishing display on both sides under oppressively hot conditions. During the fight, Ali said to Frazier, "They said you were through, Joe." Frazier said, "They lied." After 14 grueling rounds, Futch stopped the fight with Frazier having a closed left eye, an almost-closed right eye and a cut. Ali later said that it was the "closest thing to dying that I know of." In 1977, Ali told interviewer Reg Gutteridge that he felt this third Frazier fight was his best performance. When Gutteridge suggested his win over Cleveland Williams, Ali said, "No, Frazier's much tougher and rougher than Cleveland Williams".</p><span>1978</span><p>Frazier sang at the 1978 Jerry Lewis Telethon and he sang the United States national anthem before the rematch between Ali and Leon Spinks on September 15, 1978.</p><span>1981</span><p>In 1981, Frazier attempted a comeback. He drew over 10 rounds with hulking Floyd "Jumbo" Cummings in Chicago, <a href=#>Illinois</a>. It was a bruising battle with mixed reviews. He then retired for good.</p><span>1984</span><p>In 1984, Frazier was the special <a href=#>Referee</a> for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes at Starrcade '84, awarding the match to Flair due to Rhodes' excessive bleeding.</p><span>1986</span><p>In 1986, Frazier appeared as the "corner man" for Mr. T against Roddy Piper at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum as part of WrestleMania 2. In 1989, Frazier joined Ali, Foreman, Norton and Holmes for the tribute special <i>Champions Forever</i>.</p><span>1992</span><p>Frazier appeared as himself in an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> - "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" in 1992, in which he was supposed to have been beaten up by Barney Gumble in Moe's Tavern. Frazier's son objected; so, Frazier was instead shown beating up Gumble and putting him in a trash can. Frazier appeared in another episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> - "Homer's Paternity Coot" in 2006. He appeared on-screen in the 8th series of The <a href=#>Celebrity</a> Apprentice (USA) television show as a guest-attendee at a Silent Auction event held for the season finale (won by Joan Rivers). Frazier appeared as himself in the Academy Award-winning 1976 movie, <i>Rocky</i>. Since the debut of the Fight Night series of games made by EA <a href=#>Sports</a>, Frazier appeared in <i>Fight Night 2004</i>, <i>Fight Night Round 2</i>, <i>Fight Night Round 3</i>, <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> and <i>Fight Night Champion</i>.</p><span>1996</span><p>Frazier released his autobiography in March 1996, entitled <i>Smokin' Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight Champion of the World, Smokin' Joe Frazier</i>. Frazier promoted the book with a memorable appearance on <i>The Howard Stern Show</i> on January 23, 1996.</p><span>2001</span><p>For years afterwards, Frazier retained his bitterness towards Ali and suggested that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome was a form of <a href=#>Divine</a> retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a <i>New York Times</i> article, saying "In a way, Joe's right. I said a lot of things in the heat of the moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I apologize for that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight". Frazier reportedly "embraced it", though he later retorted that Ali only apologized to a newspaper, not to him. He said: "I'm still waiting [for him] to say it to me." To this Ali responded: "If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla."</p><span>2006</span><p>Frazier continued to train young fighters, although he needed multiple operations for back injuries sustained in a car accident. He and Ali reportedly attempted a reconciliation in his final years, but in October 2006 Frazier still claimed to have won all three bouts between the two. He declared to a <i>Times</i> reporter, when questioned about his bitterness toward Ali, "I am what I am."</p><span>2009</span><p>Frazier attempted to revive his music interests in late 2009/2010. Notably popular for singing 'Mustang Sally,' both Frazier and manager Leslie R. Wolff teamed up with Welsh Rock Solo <a href=#>Artist</a> Jayce Lewis to release his repertoire in the U.K., later visiting the Welshman in U.K. to host a string of after dinner speeches and music developments. It would notably be Frazier's last U.K. appearance.</p><span>2011</span><p>Frazier was diagnosed with liver cancer in late September 2011. By November 2011, he was under hospice care, where he died on November 7. Upon hearing of Frazier's death, Muhammad Ali said, "The world has lost a great champion. I will always remember Joe with respect and admiration." Frazier's private funeral took place on November 14 at the Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church in Philadelphia and in addition to friends and family was attended by Muhammad Ali, Don King, Larry Holmes, Magic Johnson, Dennis Rodman, among others. He was later buried at the Ivy Hill Cemetery, a short drive from the Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church.</p><span>2012</span><p>Joe Frazier was the 12th child born to Dolly Alston-Frazier and Rubin in Beaufort, South Carolina. He was raised in a rural community of Beaufort called Laurel Bay. Frazier said he was always close to his father, who carried him when he was a toddler "over the 10 acres of farmland" the Fraziers worked as sharecroppers "to the still where he made his bootleg corn liquor, and into town on Saturdays to buy the necessities that a family of 10 needed." Young Frazier was affectionately called "Billie Boy."</p><span>2013</span><p>Ultimately, Frazier won a 15-round unanimous decision by scores of 9‚Äì6, 11‚Äì4, and 9‚Äì6. Ali was taken to hospital immediately after the fight to check that his severely swollen right side jaw (which was apparent in post-fight interviews) wasn't actually broken. Frazier also spent time in hospital during the ensuing month, the exertions of the fight having been exacerbated by hypertension and a kidney infection.</p><span>2014</span><p>According to an article from The <i>New York Times</i>, "over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a combination of his own generosity and na√Øvet√©, his carousing, and failed <a href=#>Business</a> opportunities. The other headliners from his fighting days‚ÄîAli, George Foreman, and Larry Holmes‚Äîare millionaires." Asked about his situation, Frazier became playfully defensive, but would not reveal his financial status. "Are you asking me how much money I have?" he said. "I got plenty of money. I got a stack of $100 bills rolled up over there in the back of the room." Frazier blamed himself, partly, for not effectively promoting his own image. In a 2006 HBO documentary on the fight in Manila, Frazier was interviewed living in a one-room apartment on the second floor of his gym.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1944 births</a> <a href=#>2011 deaths</a> <a href=#>African-American boxers</a> <a href=#>Boxers at the 1964 Summer Olympics</a> <a href=#>Boxers from Pennsylvania</a> <a href=#>Deaths from cancer in Pennsylvania</a> <a href=#>Deaths from liver cancer</a> <a href=#>Heavyweight boxers</a> <a href=#>International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees</a> <a href=#>Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics</a> <a href=#>Olympic boxers of the United States</a> <a href=#>Olympic gold medalists for the United States in boxing</a> <a href=#>Sportspeople from Beaufort, South Carolina</a> <a href=#>Sportspeople from Philadelphia</a> <a href=#>Sportspeople with a vision impairment</a> <a href=#>World Boxing Association champions</a> <a href=#>World Boxing Council champions</a> <a href=#>World heavyweight boxing champions</a> <a href=#>American male boxers</a> <a href=#>The Ring magazine champions</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeapLJustGimGamlal6uLvRrZ9mbmhufXU%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoe-fria-net-worth-68904.html&text=Joe%20Fria%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-fria-net-worth-68904.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-fria-net-worth-68904.html&title=Joe%20Fria%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoe-fria-net-worth-68904.html&title=Joe%20Fria%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-fria-net-worth-68904.html&title=Joe%20Fria%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-fria-net-worth-68904.html&description=Joe%20Fria%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./marias-portuguese-table.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maria's Portuguese Table | PBS">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fans-question-khloe-kardashians-real-father-based-on-1-key-physical-trait-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Question Khlo Kardashian's Real Father Based on 1 Key Physical Trait">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
