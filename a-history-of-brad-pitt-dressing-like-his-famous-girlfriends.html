This is not a new phenomenon either. People have done their digging and found that for as long as Brad Pitt has been famous, he has been coordinating his outfits with his partners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is On Brad Pitt's Secret List Of Stars He'll Never Work With Again?</a></span></p><p>Whether it is intentional or unintentional remains a mystery. But it is no mystery that Brad Pitt has indeed, matched with Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Aniston, and Gwenyth Paltrow, whose twinsie moment has been a tabloid favorite moment for quite some time.</p><h2 id=gwenyth-paltrow-and-the-39-accidental-39-twinning-moment><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Gwenyth Paltrow and The 'Accidental' Twinning Moment</span></h2><p>According to<a href=#> Gwenyth Paltrow</a>, it is not so much that he likes to look like his dates but rather they want to look like him. That's her side of the story at least. <a href=#>Paltrow commented so on Twitter and Instagram</a> as a joke. Although they broke up years ago, the moment when Paltrow and Pitt had matching blonde hair with a side part and all-black outfits is still a fan favorite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-their-other-twinning-moments><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>All Their Other Twinning Moments</span></h2><p>The time when he and Paltrow looked like blonde twins was hardly their only time they matched outfits. There is also the time when they both wore white shirts and pants with matching sunglasses, the time they had semi-matching silver coats, and more, especially sunglasses. Pitt is not necessarily known for his accessories, unlike other celebrities like Johnny Depp who is rarely seen without at least a couple of necklaces and rings. One thing that Pitt does often wear, and matches with his partners, is sunglasses. Paltrow and Pitt were seen in matching sunglasses all the time before they broke up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-time-he-and-juliette-lewis-had-the-same-hair><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Time He and Juliette Lewis Had The Same Hair</span></h2><p>The famous Paltrow photo shows that Pitt does not just like to match shirts and sunglasses, but haircuts as well. One famous hair match was with Juliette Lewis. In one paparazzi photo, the pair can be seen with a medium-length cut and both had a middle part in their hair. Funny enough, Pitt's hair is longer than Lewis's in the photo.</p><h2 id=white-tee-and-jeans-a-la-shalane-mccall><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>White Tee and Jeans A La Shalane McCall</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCall and Pitt were both on the show Dallas, although Pitt's tenure was much shorter as McCall was a featured player. Still, the two seemed to have hit it off and rumors began to circulate they were dating, <a href=#>although McCall's mother denies the rumor</a> as Pitt was 24 and McCall was only 15 at the time. Still, a cozy moment was captured in a photo during a ski trip they took in the late 1980s. The two are in classic '80s casual wear with a white graphic t-shirt and jeans underneath a comfy puffy ski coat.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Just Realized The Big Age Gap Between Brad Pitt And His '90s Girlfriends</a></span></p><h2 id=all-the-times-he-and-jennifer-aniston-matched><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>All The Times He And Jennifer Aniston Matched</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While with Aniston, the pair was widely considered one of Hollywood's hottest couples, and they had the style to match that reputation. In one Paparazzi snapshot, we see them both in small framed sunglasses, a popular choice in the 1990s, and baggie cargo pants. There is also the time they had short straight hair and beige suits, the time they both had boots and jackets (although they wore different hats), and the time Aniston complemented Pitt's black suit with a black evening gown. It would seem that black is a top choice for Pitt.</p><h2 id=all-the-times-he-and-angelina-jolie-matched><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>All The Times He And Angelina Jolie Matched</span></h2><p>After Aniston came Angelina Jolie, and so the tradition continued. Pitt and Jolie matched outfits and hairdos almost every time <a href=#>they were seen in public</a>. In one film premiere, we can see them both with slicked back hair, and in another we see them in black suits and large square framed sunglasses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-times-he-and-angelina-jolie-wore-similar-outfits-to-every-premiere><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Times He And Angelina Jolie Wore Similar Outfits To Every Premiere</span></h2><p>This is not the first time someone has noticed a pattern in Brad Pitt's fashion choices. Brangelina was still a thing in 2008, a writer for Glamour noticed that Pitt and Jolie had a little trick for always looking so good at their movie premieres: they stuck to the same (or at least very similar) outfits <a href=#>for each red carpet moment</a>. Pitt would usually have a 3-piece black suit, open at the collar, and a white shirt. Angelina Jolie would be there on his arm in an elegant all-black evening dress.</p><h2 id=who-likes-black-more><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Who Likes Black More?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The question has to be asked, who liked black more, Jolie or Pitt? Black does match Jolie's famously dark and serious personality, but Pitt just looks so good in black. (To be fair so does Jolie, it matches her skin tone perfectly). So another question to be asked, who wore black better? That's one for the fashion police to decide.</p><h2 id=the-lovely-florals-on-christina-applegate><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Lovely Florals On Christina Applegate</span></h2><p>People often forget that Pitt once had a fling with the Anchorman star, but the <a href=#>floral print the two wore</a> on an outing during their time together in the early 1990s is unforgettable. With bedhead, almost grunge-like, hair cuts, Pitt wore a floral suit vest to compliment Applegate's floral dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Christina Applegate Ditched Brad Pitt Mid-Date</a></span></p><h2 id=and-the-rest><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And The Rest...</span></h2><p>Let's take a moment to remember some of the many other starlets and outfits that are in Brad Pitt's archives. There's the long hair and wide brim hats that he and Jill Schoelen wore. There's the long hair and even longer coats that he matched with Thandie Newton. The hippie-dippie look that he and Jitka Pohledek rocked on their nights out together. And yes, there are also many other times when he and his date were always in all black. Whether intentional or not, noticing Brad Pitt's fashion-savvy pairing with his dates is just one of those things you can unsee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZqCZqMGwvthmpp9lkqeupXnPoqutZZSnsrS%2FyKeeZqSZoLJutMisZJ%2BZnaTCtHnGoqmlnqKesq%2Bw0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-history-of-brad-pitt-dressing-like-his-famous-girlfriends.html&text=A%20History%20Of%20Brad%20Pitt%20Dressing%20Like%20His%20Famous%20Girlfriends&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-history-of-brad-pitt-dressing-like-his-famous-girlfriends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-history-of-brad-pitt-dressing-like-his-famous-girlfriends.html&title=A%20History%20Of%20Brad%20Pitt%20Dressing%20Like%20His%20Famous%20Girlfriends" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-history-of-brad-pitt-dressing-like-his-famous-girlfriends.html&title=A%20History%20Of%20Brad%20Pitt%20Dressing%20Like%20His%20Famous%20Girlfriends" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-history-of-brad-pitt-dressing-like-his-famous-girlfriends.html&title=A%20History%20Of%20Brad%20Pitt%20Dressing%20Like%20His%20Famous%20Girlfriends" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-history-of-brad-pitt-dressing-like-his-famous-girlfriends.html&description=A%20History%20Of%20Brad%20Pitt%20Dressing%20Like%20His%20Famous%20Girlfriends" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alesia-glidewell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alsia Glidewell - MobyGames">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./susie-moss-stirling-moss-wife-biography-age-height-wiki-6130-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Susie Moss, Stirling Moss Wife: Biography, Age, Height, Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
