However, there was a fourth person in the car who survived the horrific tragedy. Trevor Rees-Jones was bodyguard to Dodi and Diana and was badly injured in the crash. So what does he remember, and where is he now? &nbsp;</p><h2>What happened to Trevor Rees-Jones?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eFcix7ZIMgU data-wc=66>Trevor was the sole survivor of the crash, but was left very badly injured. He was in a coma for ten days and suffered catastrophic facial injuries, including breaking every bone in his face, which was reconstructed with 150 titanium parts by using a photo from before the crash. He spent a month in a hospital in Paris before being able to return to the UK.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Have you watch The Crown season 6 yet?</figure><p id=e4XHR4etHUS data-wc=76>At the time, the surgeon who reconstructed his face told the BBC that it was "completely smashed [and crushed]." He added: "I have never seen so many fractures on a man who was still alive." Speaking to CNN about his own experience, he said: "I had a tracking tube out of my throat so I couldn’t make any sound… [I] just had to lie there and just absorb it, and that was quite difficult to do."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eOwmTg3lOgu data-wc=27>He added: "Anytime I look at the vehicle, it amazes me how anyone got out of there alive, especially myself who was sitting in the front seat."&nbsp;</p><h2>What does Trevor Rees-Jones remember?&nbsp;</h2><p id=e2zDfni76_cL data-wc=43>Trevor has spoken about his lack of memory from the crash, revealing that he could only remember leaving the Ritz, and nothing about the events of the incident, saying: "I’m the only person who can tell people for real, and I can’t remember."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1004d96a9697-gettyimages-727013459.jpg><p id=enn45l0chfp5 data-wc=94>He told The Guardian: "At the time, I wanted to know. I was desperate to know… If you like, it's 'survivor's guilt'. I thought a while ago it would be a lot less hassle if I wasn't around, and things could have moved on." He added in an interview with 60 Minutes: "If Henri Paul had been driving so fast that it was a security risk, that his driving was—that he couldn’t control the car, that it was going too fast, then I would like to think that I would have said, 'Slow down.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7924fe6a3cf2-gettyimages-79185483.jpg><p id=eF50FvrsPobJ data-wc=69>He gave evidence at the inquest, claiming that he had vague memories of Diana saying Dodi’s name and a motorbike driving alongside the car, but admitted that he wasn’t sure if they were real. Speaking about a conspiracy to kill Diana, he said: "I am not part of a conspiracy to suppress the truth at all. All I have ever done is give the truth as I see it."</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">The Crown season five recap</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cfe4e23c40eb-the-crown-season-five.png><ul><li><strong>Prince Charles and Princess Diana marriage breakdown</strong></li></ul><p id=e3R8Z3Pw0d>Season five began with Princess Diana devastated that their second honeymoon was halted abruptly by Princes Charles.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>"Queen Victoria Syndrome"</strong></li></ul><p id=e4XkRiVzKJk>Prince Charles met with the Prime Minister after a published poll about the public's opinion of the monarchy.
