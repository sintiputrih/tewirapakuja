Additionally, the most of the songs on the band’s By the Way album from 2002 were written about his second ex-girlfriend, Yohanna Logan, a fashion designer.</p><p>Anthony was spotted dating model Wanessa Milhonem after divorcing Helena.</p><p>Even though Wanessa and Anthony are 30 years apart in age, the singer was used to this because Helena was 32 years younger.</p><h2 id=firstHeading class="firstHeading mw-first-heading"><span id=Anthony_Kiedis_Bio>Anthony Kiedis Bio</span></h2><p>Anthony Kiedis is a musician from the United States. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a rock band, and he is its lead singer and frontman.</p><p>Since the band’s inception in 1983, he has been a member of it. Although he is well renowned for his rapid-fire rapping, in his more recent albums he has begun to emphasize his singing more. Anthony is and was one of the most popular rockers and frontmen; yet, he has struggled greatly with his singing ability up until the time that he recorded the Californication album, at which point he felt that he had good control over his voice. His singing ability has vastly developed over the course of his life, eventually reaching its pinnacle on Stadium Arcadium. Within the band and among the general public, he is well-known for his charismatic performance on stage as well as his great sex appeal. In 2004, he published a memoir book under the title Scar Tissue, which was quite successful and made it all the way up to number 17 on the list of best sellers.</p><p>Anthony struggled with substance abuse throughout his life, beginning in his youth and continuing up until the time of the release of the album One Hot Minute. Since December 24, 2000, he has not used illegal drugs. Kiedis was with Heather Christie, who is also the mother of his son Everly Bear Kiedis. Kiedis was with Christie throughout this time. He currently resides in Malibu, California, with his kid.</p><table class="infobox vcard plainlist"><tbody readability=2><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row><span class=nowrap>Birth name</span></th><td class="infobox-data nickname">Anthony Kiedis</td></tr><tr readability=4><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Born</th><td class=infobox-data>November 1, 1962<span class="noprint ForceAgeToShow">&nbsp;(age&nbsp;59)</span><br>Grand Rapids, Michigan</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Genres</th><td class=infobox-data>Rock</td></tr><tr><th class=infobox-label scope=row>Instruments</th><td class="infobox-data note">Vocals</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Anthony_Kiediss_Parents_Wifes_Name><strong>Anthony Kiedis’s Parents & Wife’s Name</strong></span></h2><p>Anthony Kiedis was born in Maryland, the U.S. By profession, he is an American singer and songwriter.

This name was borrowed from his father’s stage name, Blackie Dammett, and was used by Kiedis. His early credits include the television show F.I.S.T. and the ABC Afterschool Special It’s a Mile from Here to Glory, both of which aired in 1978. Kiedis resumed his acting career in the 1990s, and one of his first roles was as a rowdy surfer named Tone in the 1991 film Point Break, which also starred Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. In the 1994 film, “The Chase,” Charlie Sheen played a troubled guy who tried to evade the authorities with a young woman he had kidnapped. The roles that Flea and Kiedis played in the film were those of metalheads who chased Sheen’s character in a four-by-four truck and ended up crashing.</p><p>Because his father was a failed actor who sold drugs, this had a huge affect on Kiedis, as the two of them would frequently use marijuana and cocaine together. Kiedis’s mother was a musician who had a significant influence on Kiedis. Kiedis had his first experience with heroin at the age of 14, when he mistook the drug for cocaine and consumed it by accident. Kiedis, who at the time was performing under the stage name of Cole Dammett, got his first acting part in the film F.I.S.T. in 1978 thanks to the help of his father, Blackie. He played the role of the son of Sylvester Stallone’s character. In the same year, he would go on to land two more acting gigs, the first of which was a role in an ABC Afterschool Special, and the second was a role in the film Jokes My Folks Never Told Me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5ikeqq%2FjJqlraCfo8Zut8iem6KrXay2p7GMppyerF2ptaZ50Z6bZqCfqXqktMiloGaolaW9pr7SZqqippeav7R5wqGgpZxdmsOmvsuyZJudkad6rLXEnaCsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-anthony-kiedis-wife-meet-the-red-hot-chili-peppers-singers-child-everly-bear-kiedis.html&text=Who%20Is%20Anthony%20Kiedis%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20Singer%27s%20Child%20Everly%20Bear%20Kiedis&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-anthony-kiedis-wife-meet-the-red-hot-chili-peppers-singers-child-everly-bear-kiedis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-anthony-kiedis-wife-meet-the-red-hot-chili-peppers-singers-child-everly-bear-kiedis.html&title=Who%20Is%20Anthony%20Kiedis%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20Singer%27s%20Child%20Everly%20Bear%20Kiedis" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-anthony-kiedis-wife-meet-the-red-hot-chili-peppers-singers-child-everly-bear-kiedis.html&title=Who%20Is%20Anthony%20Kiedis%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20Singer%27s%20Child%20Everly%20Bear%20Kiedis" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-anthony-kiedis-wife-meet-the-red-hot-chili-peppers-singers-child-everly-bear-kiedis.html&title=Who%20Is%20Anthony%20Kiedis%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20Singer%27s%20Child%20Everly%20Bear%20Kiedis" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-anthony-kiedis-wife-meet-the-red-hot-chili-peppers-singers-child-everly-bear-kiedis.html&description=Who%20Is%20Anthony%20Kiedis%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20Singer%27s%20Child%20Everly%20Bear%20Kiedis" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-christian-bale-doomed-the-sequel-to-terminator-salvation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Christian Bale Doomed The Sequel To Terminator: Salvation">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bmf-when-will-episode-7-air-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When Will Episode 7 Air?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
