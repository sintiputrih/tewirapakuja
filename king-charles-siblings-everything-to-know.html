The 73-year-old is currently 17th in line to the throne, although this is mainly down to male-orientated primogeniture rules that meant when Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were born, Anne moved behind them and their children in the order of succession.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="What King Charles' cancer diagnosis means for other senior royals" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d066d74870cb-gettyimages-1452320526.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="What King Charles' cancer diagnosis means for other senior royals" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>What King Charles' cancer diagnosis means for other senior royals</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eTzZxUkGkQu data-wc=33>Anne has had <a class=hm-link href=#>an incredibly interesting life</a>, with the royal previously dating Andrew Parker-Bowles, the ex-husband of Queen Camilla, was nearly kidnapped back in 1974 and has had two marriages and two children.</p><p id=eJVIDFUQHxE data-wc=53>In 1968, Anne met Mark Phillips, a lieutenant in the 1st Queen's Dragoon Guards, and the pair would go on to get engaged in 1973.

Anne became the first British royal to remarry since Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, in 1905.</p><p id=e4Cdm7HapVr data-wc=33>Alongside her two children, Anne is also a doting grandmother.

The home has been the base of operations for Anne since 1976.</p><p id=eFPr9XahvkT data-wc=55>Anne and Charles have a famously strong relationship, with the Princess Royal essentially being one of the King's right-hand women.

However, Andrew and Sarah's relationship broke down, with the pair divorcing in 1996.

Edward has enjoyed a relatively low profile, however, the royal still takes on many roles within the royal family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a33555f94d5a-king-charles-prince-edward-go-karts.jpg><p id=eKFs8ENc3hmf data-wc=56>Edward, who is 14th in line to the throne, found love with <a class=hm-link href=#>Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh</a>, with the pair walking down the aisle on 19 June 1999.

The pair were close in their childhood, with sweet photos seeing the then-teenaged Prince playing around with his younger brother, but there have also been times of hardship. In 2001, Edward's former production company allegedly invaded the privacy of Prince William while he was studying, a move which angered Charles. However, the brothers have put their feud behind them, with Edward supporting his older brother during his coronation, with <a class=hm-link href=#>a sweet unseen moment</a> being aired in a BBC documentary.</p><p><b><i>LISTEN: Inside recent royal health stories</i></b></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
