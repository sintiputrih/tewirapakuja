Colleen Wolfe’s Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Colleen Wolfe has been married to her husband, John Gonzalez, for over eleven years.</p><p>Gonzalez is a sportswriter best known for his coverage of the NBA. He is the host of the podcast The Ringer NBA Show: Heart Check. He hosts the podcast on Sports Illustrated every Wednesday.</p><p>The couple dated for several years before getting married in September 2011. They celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary on September 7, 2021.</p><p>Based on their social media posts, we can conclude that the couple has a healthy relationship. Several of John’s photos can be found on Colleen’s Instagram.</p><p>Similarly, John carries Colleen with him wherever he goes, if not in the flesh, then in a photograph.&nbsp;Gonzalez has a signature picture of Wolfe that he always carries with him and never forgets to display her whenever he takes a picture and posts it on Twitter.</p><p>Previously, John worked for the Philadelphia Inquirer as a sports columnist, TV host, and analyst for NBCSportsPhilly. He was also the host of the Comcast Sportsnet show The 700 Level.</p><p>He resigned from the Inquirer Sports Station to relocate to the West Coast. He moved to Boston to work as a senior writer for Philly Mag’s sister publication, Boston.</p><p>Colleen, on the other hand, is an NFL Network on-air personality. She hosts a number of shows on the network, including Good Morning Football on weekends and NFL GameDay Kickoff before Thursday Night Football.</p><p>Prior to joining NFL Network in 2014, she worked for WTXF-TV, Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia, and Sports Radio 94 WIP.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-colleen-wolfe-and-john-gonzalez-have-children></span>Does Colleen Wolfe And John Gonzalez Have Children?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Colleen Wolfe and John Gonzalez have never mentioned anything about their children online.</p><p>We believe the couple has yet to plan for their children. As Wolfe is 37 years old and John is currently 45 many had assumed that the pair were parenting their children.</p><p>However, it does not appear that they have children, and to protect their privacy they have kept them out of the public eye.</p><p>They are currently focused on their careers and may have children in the near future.</p><p>However, the duo has a pet dog named Doug, whom they adore just as much as their children.</p><p>We will update you with the news concerning their offspring as soon as they make any announcement about it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-gonzalezs-net-worth-how-rich-is-a-sportswriter></span>John Gonzalez’s Net Worth, How Rich Is A Sportswriter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Gonzalez is a sportswriter who has a net worth of $50,000 as of 2022.</p><p>His primary source of income as of now is Sports Illustrated, where he is a senior writer and the host of a podcast. According to&nbsp;Glassdoor, the annual salary for a Senior Editor at Sports Illustrated is $119,184.</p><p>The extra pay is estimated to be $7,721 per year. Bonuses, stock options, commissions, profit sharing, and tips are all possible forms of additional compensation.</p><p>He is the host and executive producer of the new flagship podcast at Sports Illustrated Weekly.</p><p>He’ll take you on a Wednesday journey through various interviews, on-the-field reporting, features, and analyses from some of the best storytellers in sports.</p><p>Prior to his prominence, he was a daily newspaper columnist in his hometown of Philadelphia. He has also hosted a 97.5 midday sports-talk show at Inquirer in addition to several radio and television shows.</p><p>He has done a ton of podcasts and written a ton of magazine articles. However, he considered his recent particular media outlet particularly exciting since it’s the continuation of a lifelong crush on SI.</p><p>You can check out his&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;and&nbsp;article&nbsp;on SI.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-colleen-wolfe-from></span>Where Is Colleen Wolfe From?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Collen Wolfe is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-colleen-wolfe-doing-now></span>What Is Colleen Wolfe Doing Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>She is the weekend host of Good Morning Football and NFL GameDay Kickoff, which airs before Thursday Night Football.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-colleen-wolfe-still-married></span>Is Colleen Wolfe Still Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yes, Colleen Wolfe is still married to her husband, John Gonzalez.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-colleen-wolfe-salary></span>What Is Colleen Wolfe Salary?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Wolfe’s annual salary ranges from $50,354 to $85,456.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yjpqGmXZy8r8bApZyzZZiqwKOtzZ1kqJ5dmLytuMSepWavn6GzpnnHnqmeq12staLAjLCcZqOepMRurcGorK1lpJ2ybr%2FPqKmtq6entrWx0Wg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-john-gonzalez-husband-of-colleen-wolfe-heres-what-we-know-about-the-sportswriter.html&text=Who%20Is%20John%20Gonzalez%3f%20Husband%20Of%20Colleen%20Wolfe%20%20Heres%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20The%20Sportswriter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-john-gonzalez-husband-of-colleen-wolfe-heres-what-we-know-about-the-sportswriter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-john-gonzalez-husband-of-colleen-wolfe-heres-what-we-know-about-the-sportswriter.html&title=Who%20Is%20John%20Gonzalez%3f%20Husband%20Of%20Colleen%20Wolfe%20%20Heres%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20The%20Sportswriter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-john-gonzalez-husband-of-colleen-wolfe-heres-what-we-know-about-the-sportswriter.html&title=Who%20Is%20John%20Gonzalez%3f%20Husband%20Of%20Colleen%20Wolfe%20%20Heres%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20The%20Sportswriter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-john-gonzalez-husband-of-colleen-wolfe-heres-what-we-know-about-the-sportswriter.html&title=Who%20Is%20John%20Gonzalez%3f%20Husband%20Of%20Colleen%20Wolfe%20%20Heres%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20The%20Sportswriter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-john-gonzalez-husband-of-colleen-wolfe-heres-what-we-know-about-the-sportswriter.html&description=Who%20Is%20John%20Gonzalez%3f%20Husband%20Of%20Colleen%20Wolfe%20%20Heres%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20The%20Sportswriter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./all-7-arcs-in-tokyo-revengers-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All 7 arcs in Tokyo Revengers, ranked">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./twitch-streamer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Twitch Streamer Archives - Popular Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
