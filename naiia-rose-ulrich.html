After some time, Skeet attended the Atlantic Theater Company. Stacy Cochran, the director of the company eventually recognized him.

She then joined the Colchester County High School for Girls and went into the starting of her acting career at the age of just sixteen years old. There, she was portraying the character of the original Jenny Porter on the BBC’s “2point4 Children”.</p><p>After 2 series, she quit the show to fully focus on her career as an actress in different TV dramas like “Casualty” and “The Bill” and also in low-budget movies. Cates (then still popular as Clare Woodgate) gave auditioned for the character of Stella in the movie “A Big Adventure”. Unfortunately, she failed to be featured in the year 1995. While getting back home, she colored her hair red and retransferred herself into a seventeen-year-old Liverpudlian.
