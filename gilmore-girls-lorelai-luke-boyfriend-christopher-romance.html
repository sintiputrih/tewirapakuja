The 2000s drama about mother and daughter Lorelai and Rory has been a hit ever since it first aired as the episodes have so many hilarious jokes, quirks, and well-drawn characters to keep people coming back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lorelai fell in love many times over the course of the series, as she had a long-term relationship with Luke and also had feelings for Rory's father, Christopher, who she dated back in high school.</p><p>How does Lauren Graham really feel about Lorelai's Gilmore Girls love interests? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=lorelai-and-christopher>Lorelai And Christopher</h2><p><a href=#>Lauren Graham has a $15 million net worth</a> and she has been involved with so many interesting projects. Most recently, she played Joan on Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist and Alex in The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers.</p><p>But Lauren is always going to be asked questions about playing Lorelai Gilmore in interviews, as people are still so eager and curious to learn about her thoughts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Lauren Graham said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher was her dream partner for Lorelai</a>. According to Cheat Sheet, Michael Ausiello interviewed Lauren for a piece for TV Guide and the actress said, “The show is somewhat about wish fulfillment, and there’s something about having the original biological family back together that plays along with that theme. And I think [Christopher and Lorelai] are compelling together. But I have no idea. I don’t think they know. I think they’re seeing what the story tells them."</p><p>While fans might be surprised to hear Lauren Graham share support for the Lorelai/Christopher romance, since Luke and Lorelai seem to have been the writers' plan all along, Lauren did say that she loves Luke, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a later 2005 interview, Lauren shared that she loved seeing her character with Luke: “I was speaking in terms of the show’s idyllic point of view. I think the wish-fulfillment element would dictate that the family gets back together. But I also think Luke-Lorelai is very appealing."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About 'Gilmore Girls' Dance Marathon Episode</a></span></p><h2 id=lorelai-and-christopher-39-s-marriage>Lorelai And Christopher's Marriage</h2><p>Lorelai and Christopher definitely had a rocky time on Gilmore Girls. Fans saw so much conflict between the two characters as they came in and out of each others' lives. In season 1, Christopher came to Stars Hollow and even proposed to Lorelai, but she said no. Luke was always super wary of Chris as he knew that Lorelai had feelings for him, even if she didn't even want to admit it. And when Lorelai and Christopher got married in season 7, not everyone thought that this was smart...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, Lauren Graham <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't remember that Lorelai and Christopher got married</a>.</p><p>According to Entertainment Weekly, Lauren Graham said of season 7, “Christopher [Hayden] and I got married in that season. When we came back to do [the revival], I say something about having been married or somebody says it to me, and I was like, ‘I was never married.’ I forgot. They had to get one of the super-fan assistants to get on the phone with me to remind me. She had to tell me the whole thing. It just seemed so out of character that I literally blocked it from my memory. That was my season 7 experience.”</p><p>It's interesting to hear the actress say that it was "out of character" for Lorelai to marry Chris, as many fans were definitely amazed at this plotline.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This ‘Gilmore Girls’ Fan Theory Came True</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luke-and-lorelai>Luke And Lorelai</h2><p>Of course, Gilmore Girls fans want to know how Lauren Graham felt about her character dating Luke, since this was such a long-term relationship and they are such a popular couple.</p><p>Lauren told EW Reunites: Gilmore Girls that for this pair, opposites definitely attracted. She said, "His gruffness brings out her, sort of, flirtatiousness. There’s a chemistry there. Over time they really connect. They need each other as balance; she lightens him up and he roots her a little bit, but it took a while to get there.”</p><p>Watching a TV show and wanting two characters to be together is always a funny thing. Fans want it to happen right away but sometimes that can lead to some dull storylines, as that conflict of "won't they start dating already?" makes a show a lot to fun to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'Gilmore Girls' Cast Member Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>While it sounds like Lauren Graham thought it might have worked for Lorelai and Christopher to end up together, at least before they got married in season 7, it's good to know that the actress fully supports the Luke and Lorelai romance.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> 'Gilmore Girls': Are Lauren Graham And Alexis Bledel Good Friends?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieoqSdpL%2BmecaiqaWrXaG8s7HLmqBmpKWgsm6uzrKdq6GVo7Fur8eroKysn6W1pr6Mq6ammZ6YsnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgilmore-girls-lorelai-luke-boyfriend-christopher-romance.html&text=Heres%20How%20Lauren%20Graham%20Felt%20About%20Lorelais%20Love%20Interests%20On%20Gilmore%20Girls&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgilmore-girls-lorelai-luke-boyfriend-christopher-romance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgilmore-girls-lorelai-luke-boyfriend-christopher-romance.html&title=Heres%20How%20Lauren%20Graham%20Felt%20About%20Lorelais%20Love%20Interests%20On%20Gilmore%20Girls" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgilmore-girls-lorelai-luke-boyfriend-christopher-romance.html&title=Heres%20How%20Lauren%20Graham%20Felt%20About%20Lorelais%20Love%20Interests%20On%20Gilmore%20Girls" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgilmore-girls-lorelai-luke-boyfriend-christopher-romance.html&title=Heres%20How%20Lauren%20Graham%20Felt%20About%20Lorelais%20Love%20Interests%20On%20Gilmore%20Girls" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgilmore-girls-lorelai-luke-boyfriend-christopher-romance.html&description=Heres%20How%20Lauren%20Graham%20Felt%20About%20Lorelais%20Love%20Interests%20On%20Gilmore%20Girls" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-bonham-obituary-a-tribute-to-a-creative-soul.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Bonham Obituary, A Tribute To A Creative Soul">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./evga-releases-clc120-cl11-aio-cpu-cooler.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="EVGA Releases CLC120 CL11 AIO CPU Cooler: Simple and Affordable">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
