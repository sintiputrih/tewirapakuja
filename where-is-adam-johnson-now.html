Before joining Manchester City in February 2010, he was on loan at Watford and Leeds United. Both the FA Cup and the Premier League were won by the cunning player in 2012.</strong></p><p><strong>In 2012, Johnson went back to his old team Sunderland, where he continued to do well before being fired in February 2016. After Johnson admitted to child grooming and engaging in sexual behavior with a child, Sunderland severed connections with him. Johnson was given a six-year term, but he was released from jail after completing half of it.</strong></p><h2>What is the Net Worth of Adam Johnson? Salary, Earnings</h2><p>Adam withdrew to a secluded existence in his <strong>£2 million</strong> Castle Eden estate. Adam sold his opulent property, Tollgate Lodge, to England cricketer Ben Stones while he was incarcerated for an estimated £1.7 million. Then he provided the funding for the building of a $2 million mansion in the upscale neighborhood of Castle Eden.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Look Inside Shannon Thornton’s Secret Love Life</a></span></p><p>The residents of Castle Eden were excited to welcome Johnson back from prison, according to a ChronicleLive report. A resident of Castle Eden told the publication,</p><p><strong>“I think a lot of people were saddened by what happened but there is a thing called forgiveness and second chances.”</strong></p><p>According to The Sun, Adam hosted a “booze-fueled” party at his house to celebrate his release. Johnson has since chosen to live a life hidden from the public eye.</p><p>In <strong>January 2015</strong>, he and his ex-girlfriend Stacey Flounders had their daughter, Ayla. For the sake of their daughter, Flounders agreed to continue their friendship with Adam following his release. She swore not to restart the couple’s romance though.</p><p>She told The Mail,</p><p>“<strong>You can forgive, but I won’t ever forget what he did.”</strong></p><p>During Adam’s trial, Stacey claimed that her life “<strong>broke apart</strong>” and that she became aware of Adam’s actual character. During the trial, she gave damaging testimony, claiming that Adam had admitted to having an extramarital affair with her.</p><p>After Adam’s arrest, Stacey admitted to terminating the couple’s second child. With everything going on, “<strong>I couldn’t bring another baby into this world,</strong>” Flounders said. It was painful, but I felt forced to do it.</p><p>Adam Johnson has been listed as a sex offender and will be for fifteen years. If he intends to travel internationally, he must notify the police. To keep an eye on his online purchases, authorities now have his banking information.</p><p>In <strong>July 2021</strong>, Johnson and Stacey Flounders had a second child.</p><p>Stacey and the disgraced footballer reconciled while under quarantine, despite her claim that she wouldn’t date Johnson again. The second child of the couple was conceived as a result of the reunion. According to a source who spoke with The Sun:</p><p><strong>“Adam and Stacey are both excited to welcome a son and to be parents once more. It’s the new beginning they were hoping for. They both seem very content.”</strong></p><p>They share a home in Durham, but he is reportedly thinking of moving himself and his family abroad. Johnson issued an apology following his release from prison to all the people he had harmed, including Stacey. According to reports, Adam tried to play football again but was unable to get a team to take him on.</p><p>After his release, Adam Johnson reportedly intended to play football professionally again. He intended to write a letter to teams appealing for a job, according to the Mirror. To keep active, he started playing football in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.</p><p>According to the story, Adam’s proposal for an open letter wasn’t approved by his family.</p><p>His sister, Faye, is believed to have claimed, “Genuine thought he was joking when he informed me but he was deadly serious. If Adam couldn’t find a team in England, he supposedly intended to look overseas.</p><p>Johnson’s family had their doubts, but Christopher Stacey, the co-director of Unlock, a nonprofit organization for incarcerated individuals, believed Adam deserved a chance to prove himself on the field.</p><p>According to Stacey, who spoke to Press Association Sport,</p><p><strong>“Adam Johnson’s preoccupation with the media speaks less about him and his crime and more about us as a society.” Do we want to punish individuals indefinitely?”</strong></p><p>Few concur with Christopher’s assertion that Johnson ought to have been given a second opportunity to play. The majority of fans continue to criticize Adam, as seen by the recent sale of Adam Johnson’s boots on eBay.</p><p>In <strong>2015</strong>, Adam donned the shoes and scored in Sunderland’s victory over sworn enemies Newcastle. The boots had a<strong> £10</strong> price tag but received 14 bids before selling for <strong>£49</strong>. Rare Adam Johnson’s match-worn boots from Sunderland’s 3-0 victory over Newcastle United at the Stadium of Light, according to the item’s description.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>What Is The Real Name Of Youtuber CoryxKenshin</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jay Ajayi</a></h3>Jay Ajayi estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
