Rivera, who spent his entire 19-year career with the New York Yankees, is widely regarded as the greatest closer of all time. With an incredible repertoire of pitches, remarkable consistency, and an unmatched postseason performance, Rivera's legacy as the greatest closer is well-deserved. In this article, we will delve into the reasons why Mariano Rivera is considered the greatest closer of all time.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the key factors that sets Mariano Rivera apart from his peers is his dominance and consistency. Throughout his career, Rivera showcased an unparalleled level of dominance on the mound. His signature pitch, the cut fastball, was virtually unhittable. Batters struggled to make solid contact against Rivera, often resulting in weak ground balls or broken bats. His ability to consistently throw strikes and induce ground balls made him a nightmare for opposing hitters.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Rivera's consistency is another aspect that sets him apart. Despite the physical demands of the closer role, Rivera remained remarkably consistent year after year. He recorded at least 30 saves in a season 15 times, and he holds the record for the most saves in a career with 652. His ability to perform at such a high level for such an extended period is a testament to his talent and work ethic.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Rivera's regular-season statistics are impressive on their own, it is his postseason performance that truly solidifies his status as the greatest closer of all time. Rivera was a crucial part of the Yankees' success in the playoffs, helping them win five World Series titles during his career.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In postseason play, Rivera was simply untouchable. He holds the record for the most postseason saves with 42, a record that may never be broken. In 96 career playoff appearances, Rivera posted a remarkable 0.70 ERA, allowing just 11 earned runs in 141 innings pitched. His ability to rise to the occasion in high-pressure situations was unmatched, and he often delivered in the most critical moments of the game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Beyond his on-field performance, Mariano Rivera was also known for his leadership and mentorship. He was a role model to his teammates, displaying professionalism, humility, and a strong work ethic. Rivera was always willing to share his knowledge and experience with younger players, helping them develop and improve their skills.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Rivera's impact extended beyond the Yankees' clubhouse. He was revered by fans and respected by players from opposing teams. His unwavering sportsmanship and respect for the game earned him the admiration of his peers, making him a true ambassador for the sport.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Mariano Rivera's impact on the game of baseball goes beyond his individual achievements. He revolutionized the role of the closer and redefined what it means to be a dominant relief pitcher. Prior to Rivera, closers were often used for one or two innings at most. Rivera, however, proved that a closer could be relied upon for multiple innings and could dominate for an extended period.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Rivera's success paved the way for future closers to be used in a similar manner. Teams began to rely more heavily on their closers, using them in high-leverage situations earlier in the game. Rivera's influence on the game can be seen in the way modern closers are utilized.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Mariano Rivera's legacy as the greatest closer of all time is well-deserved. His dominance, consistency, postseason excellence, leadership, and impact on the game set him apart from his peers. From his unhittable cut fastball to his remarkable postseason performances, Rivera's career was filled with memorable moments. His impact on the game of baseball will be felt for generations to come, and his legacy as the greatest closer of all time will stand the test of time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7JlnZa%2Fqq3NqGSroaaav6J5yKxkraCVYrSzscCtnKysXZi5sL%2FEq2Sonl2Wua1506Kkng%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-mariano-rivera-is-the-greatest-closer-of-all-time.html&text=Why%20Mariano%20Rivera%20is%20the%20Greatest%20Closer%20of%20All-Time&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-mariano-rivera-is-the-greatest-closer-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-mariano-rivera-is-the-greatest-closer-of-all-time.html&title=Why%20Mariano%20Rivera%20is%20the%20Greatest%20Closer%20of%20All-Time" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-mariano-rivera-is-the-greatest-closer-of-all-time.html&title=Why%20Mariano%20Rivera%20is%20the%20Greatest%20Closer%20of%20All-Time" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-mariano-rivera-is-the-greatest-closer-of-all-time.html&title=Why%20Mariano%20Rivera%20is%20the%20Greatest%20Closer%20of%20All-Time" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-mariano-rivera-is-the-greatest-closer-of-all-time.html&description=Why%20Mariano%20Rivera%20is%20the%20Greatest%20Closer%20of%20All-Time" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tinsley-norris-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="An Unexpected Loss!
