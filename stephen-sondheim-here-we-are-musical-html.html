The future collaborators soon were comparing their tastes not just in plays but in movies, Sondheim’s greatest cultural passion after music. Lapine had recently seen and liked <a href=#>The Exterminating Angel</a>, the 1962 classic by the Spanish Mexican director <a href=#>Luis Buñuel</a>. Sondheim was a fan of Buñuel’s 1972 <a href=#>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</a>. Lapine thought it might be a possible project. They set up a screening, but nothing came of it. When they reconvened at Sondheim’s Turtle Bay townhouse after Labor Day, Lapine arrived with a bunch of random images to see if they might strike any creative sparks. The last in the pile was a postcard of Georges Seurat’s A Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884. It inspired a torrent of riffing, and a week later Lapine brought Sondheim the first five pages of what would become Sunday in the Park With George.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2np2c000n3b6xt8id0gbk@published data-word-count=173>This fall, <a href=#>Here We Are</a>, Sondheim’s musical adaptation of both Discreet Charm and Exterminating Angel, written with the playwright <a href=#>David Ives</a>, will have its premiere — more than four decades after Lapine floated the notion of a Buñuel musical, a decade after Sondheim and Ives started serious work on it, and nearly two years after Sondheim’s death late Thanksgiving Night in 2021. That Sondheim had left behind a full show came as a shock even to many in his circle. He often talked about his frustration with the project’s slow progress as the months and then years piled up and he headed toward his tenth decade. In the spring of 2017, he sent me a video of a workshop of its first act led by Kelli O’Hara and Steven Pasquale, asking for my thoughts. That fragment was intriguing as far as it went, but he was unsure of what would come next. After that, the show, known by the placeholder rubric Buñuel, never seemed to move forward or even settle on a title.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2np3s000o3b6xynv4i94x@published data-word-count=252>This was nothing new for Steve, who was congenitally behind on his work and loved kvetching anxiously about it, always with acutely self-mocking humor. Before Buñuel, he’d been plenty tardy in finishing the critical and autobiographical essays that formed the spine of his two magisterial volumes of collected lyrics. And what was the rush, anyway? Who thought he would die anytime soon? Not me, and not many others who knew him. Yes, he was 91 at the end, but he wasn’t ill and had ducked COVID by retreating with his husband, Jeff Romley, to their second home in Roxbury, Connecticut. Steve remained as sharp, curious, and playful as ever. My last phone conversation with him the weekend before his death was typical. After savoring in giddy detail the just-opened Classic Stage revival of Assassins, he let loose with a new anecdote about the most notoriously exasperating of his Broadway collaborators, the West Side Story and Gypsy librettist Arthur Laurents (he knew I was a ready audience for Arthur horror stories), then invited me to join him that Wednesday to see two new American plays running in repertory on Broadway. The doubleheader was tempting, but I was on my way to a family Thanksgiving in California. So we looked forward instead to a dinner I’d set up for after the holidays in New York, where he could finally meet one of his all-time favorite actors, Harriet Walter, whom I’d come to know professionally and who would be visiting from her home in England.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2np5t000p3b6xoy47g057@published data-word-count=83>When Steve’s lawyer and friend Rick Pappas called me in Los Angeles before dawn early Friday morning to deliver the devastating news, it caught me completely off guard, as it did so many others. I couldn’t digest it. I had first met Steve 50 years earlier, when I was a senior in college. I had heard and seen and admired his work my entire sentient life. He was a paternal figure for me, as for countless others he had mentored, counseled, and taught.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nph1000q3b6x6f0h40mr@published data-word-count=100>On that black Friday morning, I distracted myself by helping Rick alert the press to <a href=#>Steve’s death</a>. Steve had been a palpable presence at the two shows he had running then (a revival of <a href=#>Company</a> as well as <a href=#>Assassins</a>), both of which had holiday matinees that afternoon. The goal was to pause the announcement so the casts could be told the news in person after the curtain fell rather than learn it in the wings mid-performance from Twitter. Steve’s colleagues on the <a href=#>Steven Spielberg film of West Side</a> <a href=#>Story</a>, gathering for its imminent world premiere, also had to be notified.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nppl000r3b6xzqcuk2uo@published data-word-count=112>The secret held until the end of the day New York time. Once the news was out, I could no longer duck the reality and magnitude of the loss. It was many months before I could listen to Steve’s scores again or see a production of his shows without being overwhelmed by grief. It took the catharsis of <a href=#>Maria Friedman</a>’s production of <a href=#>Merrily</a> at the New York Theatre Workshop a year after Steve died — by far the most successful realization of the show he and his librettist <a href=#>George Furth</a> had revised for years after its Broadway stillbirth — to get me to start reconnecting to all the riches he left behind.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nprl000s3b6x2obkbopz@published data-word-count=148>Earlier this year, as another exhilarating Sondheim revival, Thomas Kail’s staging of <a href=#>Sweeney Todd</a>, was heading into production on Broadway, Rick called me with the surprising news that weeks before his death, Steve had authorized Buñuel for potential production. Rick asked if I might help him, David, and <a href=#>Joe Mantello</a>, the director who joined the project in 2016 and became central to its development, tell the story of its often tortured path to completion. I read the latest version of the script, heard a demo rendering of the score (with all the roles sung by the show’s musical director, Alexander Gemignani), and immersed myself in David and Joe’s intimate recollections of how Steve persisted in his art despite the obstacles of self-doubt, aging, and the isolation inflicted by a pandemic whose fallout mirrored aspects of the surreal Buñuel movies that had captured his imagination as a young man.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2npts000t3b6xjh9x3jfn@published data-word-count=92>What follows is an edited transcript of those conversations, which took place this summer ahead of rehearsals for a September 28 first preview at <a href=#>the Shed</a> in Hudson Yards. David and Joe also shared some contemporaneous emails about the show’s progress (or lack of it). As we talked, we found ourselves not just examining the creation of Steve’s final work but also looking back, perhaps with a little perspective now, on what this remarkable artist and person meant to the theater and to those of us who knew him and loved him.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2npvh000u3b6xymtf3qma@published data-word-count=21><strong>Frank Rich:</strong> David, you first started working with Steve several years before Joe.

We sat and we drank and we chatted, and finally I said to him, “Steve, you said you wanted to talk about something, and you said it wasn’t important.” He said, “Did I say that?” I said, “Yes you did.” And he said, “Well, I have this idea for a musical and I wondered if you wanted to work on it.” And what do you say to Stephen Sondheim when he says that? I said, “Great. What’s the idea?” So he tells me, and I said, “I like that idea.” And he said, “Well, I’m glad you say that because I’ve been taking some notes.” And he reached behind a pillow of his couch and he took out this manila envelope. He said, “Just tell me what you think if you don’t like them.” They were extraordinary, five or six pages of his thoughts and reflections about what the show could be.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nq09000w3b6xq6maiy5g@published data-word-count=151><strong><span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>Joe Mantello:</span></strong> Being summoned to his house is terrifying.

With <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>Assassins,</span> I was a director who at that point hadn’t really directed a musical, and I had some ideas to present to <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-4 tabindex=0>John</span> and Steve about how I wanted to do it. I went to Steve’s townhouse, and it’s intimidating. There he is, and you’re this guy who’s going to come in and say, “This is what I think your musical needs.” One thing I talked about was combining the roles of the Balladeer and Lee Harvey Oswald. And he listened very, very patiently and said, “I don’t think that will work for the following reasons,” and then he enumerated those reasons. But he said, <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-5 tabindex=0>“You are the director, and you have to pursue that.”</span> That’s a great collaborator to me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nq1r000x3b6xrr3ib7yc@published data-word-count=10><strong>FR:</strong> David, Steve’s initial idea for you was not Buñuel.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nq3k000y3b6xvg091hzv@published data-word-count=92><strong>DI:</strong> It was this musical called All Together Now, which I think he had pitched to various playwrights over the years. He wanted a musical that exploded a single moment in the lives of two people meeting for the first time. We’d see the moment without music and then we’d explore it musically. That would happen through other characters Steve called “the Selves,” the inner selves of the man and woman. A great idea, but this is Steve, so of course it was complicated. We went to work on it almost immediately.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nq6y000z3b6x6zm82yzz@published data-word-count=10><strong>FR:</strong> Were there ever any songs for All Together Now?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nq8q00103b6x1xez6k3l@published data-word-count=38><strong>DI:</strong> He wrote two versions of one song, as far as I know, and I thought it was a terrific song, but he was getting lost in the theme-and-variations puzzle of it and couldn’t find his way forward.</p><span class=divider-border></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cd5/4d9/339ec897af6c107e0f251ff57d36a58a88-MBDEXAN-EC005.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f9f/88d/ccef8c70db25475aa7874a577a75eef716-1823Fea-Sondheim-Toasts--BB-1--001.rdeep-vertical.w460.jpg> Film stills from The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) and The Exterminating Angel (1962). <span class=credit>Photo: 20th Century Fox; Courtesy Everett Collection.</span> <span class=shortened>Film stills from The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) and The Exterminating Angel (1962). <span class=credit>Photo: 20th Century Fox; Courtesy Everett Collection...</span> more</span> <span class=full>Film stills from The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) and The Exterminating Angel (1962). <span class=credit>Photo: 20th Century Fox; Courtesy Everett Collection.</span></span> <span class=divider-border></span><p class="clay-paragraph_prologue text-centered" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nqc900113b6xnouuqb26@published data-word-count=97><strong>IVES AND SONDHEIM abandoned All Together Now in August 2013 after they learned a new, if short-lived, Broadway musical, First Date, had an overlapping premise. Around that time, Sondheim and Ives began to work in earnest on Buñuel. Sondheim had started talking about reviving the idea a couple of years earlier, and in 2012, the artistic director of the Public Theater, Oskar Eustis, who had produced a revision of Sondheim’s previous musical, Road Show, in 2008, joined Rick Pappas in a lengthy effort to secure the underlying rights from the estates of Buñuel and the films’ screenwriters.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nqe900123b6x2uesn9cr@published data-word-count=60><strong>DI:</strong> I went over to Steve’s house, and we watched both movies. We talked about them, we took notes, we started brainstorming, and I think that we had a very good idea from pretty early on about the shape of this thing.

He was a bit like Steve. Brilliant, unorthodox, a huge variety in his work over the years. Discreet Charm is about a circle of six colorful upper-middle-class French friends who are continually in search of food — supper, a cup of coffee, whatever — but continually get stymied trying to find it. Exterminating Angel is radically different. Very severe. It’s again about a circle of society friends. This time, the group is in a mansion and they can’t get out of the fancy room they’re in. So they spend the movie “trapped,” even though all they have to do is walk out the open door. Steve and I merged the two movies and made it the same set of friends all the way through.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nqoe00153b6xdn7v8klw@published data-word-count=11><strong>FR:</strong> You decided not to set it in France or Mexico.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nqpx00163b6xwjv39ghm@published data-word-count=220><strong>DI:</strong> At first it was going to be set in France. But we came to the idea that nobody would care. Bad enough that these people have money, but they have to be French? That is loading a show with absolutely too much baggage. Setting it in America seemed an obvious way to go. We had a very good idea of the characters. A lively billionaire hedge-fund type. His wife, a society interior decorator. Her kid sister, a kind of out-there East Village lefty. And the friends who go looking for food with them. A charming Casanova who’s the ambassador of a tiny corrupt Mediterranean duchy. <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-6 tabindex=0>A ballsy talent agent,</span> very smart, very loud, always on the phone. A cosmetic surgeon for people who don’t need cosmetic surgery but get it anyway. A hapless colonel from Homeland Security and a bishop who’s going door-to-door trying to find a better job because he’s such a lousy priest. A very beautiful, very complicated young soldier who’s our love interest. Or is he? Plus the ultimate Merchant-Ivory butler. Or is he? A mysterious maid. Characters end up being stuck in the room with each other and getting to know each other. The rich have to undergo what only the poor know, which is to say, deprivation, hunger, lack of water, lack of space.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nqs300173b6xernmuecw@published data-word-count=142><strong>JM:</strong> It’s about a lot of things. Distraction and what happens when you have privilege and unlimited choices and then those choices go away. What do you have to face when you look in the mirror? I come back to Buñuel’s note when asked to prepare audiences for The Exterminating Angel: “The best explanation for The Exterminating Angel is that, rationally, there is none.” The second act is the exact opposite of the first act. This show essentially starts with movement on a road from place to place in search of a meal and the first act ends with them achieving their goal and they get a meal. The second act is the inverse. It starts after they’ve had the meal and now they’re stuck and how do they get back on the road? Steve’s love of puzzles is so well known.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nqtw00183b6xmh7knfht@published data-word-count=103><strong>FR:</strong> At the top of the second act of Sunday, of course, the characters can’t break out of Seurat’s painting. Lapine had to create a whole new story and yank them out of that century entirely if they were to move on. Here, the tone feels darker. They are truly trapped. You feel that the world is ending, that mortality looms.

The six protagonists almost always sing as a group while the solos are given to characters they meet along the way. There’s an unconventional, almost counterintuitive, approach to the score.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2ns6o001s3b6xwovco08a@published data-word-count=243><strong>DI:</strong> I think that what Steve loved about Discreet Charm was the road sequences: As we follow this group of very tony friends looking for a meal, the movie cuts away, without explanation, to them walking down a country road in beautiful sunshine with birds twittering in the background. And we just hear the sound of their footsteps. We see them walking, and walking, and walking, not talking, not relating to each other, just heading down this road. The movie probably does that three or four times. Obviously, this is Surrealism that we’re in, and it’s such a rich metaphor. But it was a conceptual challenge. Early on I was asking Steve, “Are these silent interludes, and how do we keep the audience’s interest? Is there music? What is happening in those interludes?” He wanted to begin the show with them on the road for a very long time. I spent a lot of time trying to talk him out of that because, I said, “Those sequences work in the movie because we’ve seen these characters, and to cut away to them on the road suddenly is an interjection of something mysterious. But you can’t begin with mystery if you haven’t established the world that we’re in.” He tried writing a road sequence at the beginning of the show. That was part of the big discussions early on in the show’s gestation. And, of course, the road became a directorial and production challenge.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2ns8r001t3b6xl5rkp248@published data-word-count=65><strong>JM:</strong> The practical concern that I had was they go to three different restaurants and within a couple of lines they’re back on that road. To find an elegant solution that doesn’t involve winches and things coming on and off really dictated the design of the first act. It was a thrilling process to go through, but it was a really difficult set to design.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nsaj001u3b6xkzxo1fnv@published data-word-count=107><strong>DI:</strong> In the end, as I’d hoped, we didn’t start the show with the road. Instead, we set the characters up in an opening scene and only then moved them onto the road. After that, the first act alternates between restaurant scenes and road scenes. In an old-fashioned musical, the road would have been a so-called in-one scene. The curtain would have come down and the road would have been played in front of it while the set changed to a new location. But Joe and <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-10 tabindex=0>David Zinn</span> found a brilliant way for us to move on and off the road without doing that. Modern theater magic.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class="clay-paragraph_prologue text-centered" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nsc4001v3b6xj0johak1@published data-word-count=10><strong>BUT THE WORK hit a trouble spot in late 2016.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nsdo001w3b6xbcsvwcgr@published data-word-count=147><strong>DI:</strong> When I had begun working with Steve, I had a drink with Lapine and said, “Can you give me any advice?” He said, “You have to give him a deadline.” And that really worked for Lapine — though he also said that Sondheim once asked him, “You want it Tuesday or do you want it good?” The problem is that I am not made like Lapine at all. I went to Catholic school, I did my homework, I figured everybody else did theirs. I am not the sort of person to say to anybody, Sondheim or anybody else, “I’m coming over to your house on Saturday and you have to have a song.” That is not me. That’s why it was helpful when Joe came on the project because Joe energized Steve.

I think frankly part of the reason I didn’t is that it’s just too dark in there. All Together Now at least gives room for more light. And playfulness. And he came up with a structural idea that improved things instantly. Do you think a 90-year-old man really wants to get locked into a room with nothing? I don’t think so.

There was no end in sight. There was a real lack of contact with friends and loved ones unless you saw them on a computer screen. What we were experiencing was unimaginable, and it occurred to me that this was in fact what the second half of the show might be about. There was something inherent in the piece that we weren’t aware of at the start, this idea of people being trapped inside a space because of some sort of existential terror outside. We needed to attack the section after they realize they can’t get out of the room — to take it seriously. You have to resist going back to the first act’s tone of social byplay. I floated my idea to David initially, but said, “I’m not sure about this. Don’t say anything.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nxan003v3b6xsadvwkhr@published data-word-count=163><strong>DI:</strong> Joe put the hook in and let it sit awhile. But when we talked, I remember he kept saying, “The show is finished, it really is finished, and this is why and this is why and this is why.” And it was that moment when you’re working on a show and the director points out some key thing and you realize, Oh, wait a minute, I didn’t see that about that character, or, Oh, I understand that scene now. And suddenly the whole show opened up in a way and I thought, Yes, you are right. It had been out of my hands and suddenly it felt like it was back in my hands. I had thought it was in Steve’s hands, but actually it wasn’t. It was so powerful to have the freedom of going back to work on it and just letting loose and taking it seriously, as Joe said, in a way that I don’t think we had before.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nxc2003w3b6xyfmg3735@published data-word-count=65><strong>JM:</strong> I felt that perhaps one of the things that Steve was struggling with was that once these characters realize that they could not leave this room, the score had to change. Because he had written up until the moment when they discover that for whatever reason they are unable to leave the room, and what he was struggling with was everything that came after.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nxib003x3b6xx36f38ib@published data-word-count=52><strong>DI:</strong> Steve was constantly saying, “Why are these people singing when they’re in this room?” … I would also mention that long before we got to 2021, he sent Joe and me some reading on Buñuel and pointed out that Buñuel had chosen not to have a score in The Exterminating Angel.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nxml003y3b6xoesdi60p@published data-word-count=224><strong>JM:</strong> Buñuel must have felt that there was nothing that music could add to this story, because he chose not to have a score. I thought, Oh, we’re on the right track. The story is about the absence of music. Once they are trapped in a room, these characters expressing themselves in a conventional musical-theater way would be deeply unsatisfying and detract from the story. One of Steve’s big rules was content dictates form. We had to understand that the absence of music was the score. We had to find a way to satisfy the theatrical demands of the piece while coming at it from a different point of view. So that’s basically what I pitched to Steve. I said, “I believe that this piece is finished, and I could make an intellectual case why the piece is finished. What I’m asking for is permission to go back in and present an idea, a way of tackling this that doesn’t involve you writing any more music.” I recall him being very open to it. He was really curious about what this latest inspiration was. I&nbsp;didn’t really have a clear vision. It was like we were walking on the moon at that point. We didn’t know what it was going to be, but we thought perhaps this was the answer that we’d been searching for.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nxo2003z3b6x6vm2rnm5@published data-word-count=57><strong>DI:</strong> And in fact, just to show how open Steve was to this, I said to him before we went back to work, “We may have to disrupt some of your work in Act One as we go back over this,” and that it wasn’t going to be set in stone. He said, “Go ahead and disrupt.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nxpk00403b6xawos8a6f@published data-word-count=157><strong>JM:</strong> Steve said, “I would want to keep working on it.” I said, “Well, absolutely. You’re Stephen Sondheim. But if you and David give me permission to develop this, I don’t know what the vocabulary is once the conventional score stops, but I bet we can find something that’s as interesting and as experimental as the first half.” That’s really when we all made the decision to start to reinvestigate what it might be. Somewhere around that time, right before <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-11 tabindex=0>James’s book</span> on Sunday in the Park came out, he sent it, and I read it and I found it hugely reassuring. I was reading these stories of James’s experience of writing that show with Steve, and they were almost an exact mirror of what we were going through. And though the birthing pains were difficult, I took great comfort in the fact that others had been there before us and that the end result was wonderful.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nxr000413b6x2z75s57h@published data-word-count=73><strong>DI:</strong> We should also remember that if you take Steve’s perspective for a moment, you will understand why he was open to Joe’s idea.

But we also discussed the fact that they could be handled in a number of different ways. David, your technique is so precise and you are aware of the fact that in Act Two, you have all 11 characters onstage the entire time. I remember saying to you, “Let them speak. Let them speak.” Let’s see what they have to say. Don’t worry about stage time. Editing is easy. Opening night is a long way away. Just let them speak.

The tone is not completely different, but as David continued to write, there’s this gradual deepening of the characters, and I thought, Oh, the Pina Bausch idea is no longer relevant. We can use these interludes as part of the rhythm of the play, but they can be scenes that have an underscore to them. We’re not inventing new themes. They would be based upon and built on the music that existed already. It would be a collaboration between <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-12 tabindex=0>Tunick</span> and <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-13 tabindex=0>Alex.</span> So that’s what we presented to Steve.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2nyam00493b6xe01jtjk1@published data-word-count=49><strong>DI:</strong> Steve liked what he saw, and Joe said, “Let’s set up a reading so you can actually hear it,” as a way of furthering Joe’s case.

He was endlessly curious. He was sharp. He was, if anything, too rigorous, too hard on himself. I wonder if at a certain point, with the pressure of being Stephen Sondheim, paralysis sets in. I can’t remember what part of the show we were working on, but he said, “I don’t want to repeat myself. This sounds like, ‘Blah, blah, blah’” in one of his shows.

To tamp down over-the-top expectations, it was agreed that the piece should not be staged at a commercial venue or at a nonprofit theater like the Public with a track record of sending productions on to Broadway. “If we could do it in the atrium of the Guggenheim or Whitney, we would,” Pappas was fond of saying.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2o1dk005b3b6xt07pg833@published data-word-count=108><strong>JM:</strong> We all felt that having it produced in the commercial arena was <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-16 tabindex=0>not the way that we wanted to go.</span> We wanted to find a space that was as unexpected as the show itself. When the name Stephen Sondheim is on the project, and I think he felt this more acutely than anyone, there’s an incredible pressure.

I think we’ve all gone into this as a valedictory lap for Steve, that it is the punctuation on an extraordinary career but we are going to do it on our own terms.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2o1fg005c3b6xgyp7l9gy@published data-word-count=140><strong>FR:</strong> And on Steve’s terms, I’d say. He always talked about his conviction that musical-theater songwriters never wrote anything good after they turned 60. And he was mindful that the giants often went out with Broadway fiascos that were embarrassing derivatives of their classics, like Irving Berlin’s Mr. President and Rodgers’s I Remember Mama. Here We Are differs in shape from any of Steve’s previous shows. For me, it feels like a little bit of a requiem, a little bit of a last testament. When I think about it, I don’t think of musical-theater analogues, including in Steve’s own career, but of spare, late-career experiments, whether by playwrights like Pinter and Albee or artists like Matisse and Klee. A distilled, smaller-scale version of a life’s work that is still powerful and dense with the art and humanity of its creator.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2o1hc005d3b6xcqsto6mg@published data-word-count=131><strong>DI:</strong> I think the fact that he decided to work on a musical based on two Buñuel movies tells us he didn’t want to write I Remember Mama or Mr. President. But speaking to your point about his age, I think that one of the reasons why he was slowing down in 2018 was that he was getting closer and closer to a story about people who enter a room that they can’t get out of. That must have been working on him subconsciously. And the drag of that was what became palpable to me. I heard from him all the time that nobody ever wrote anything after a certain age, and I said to him, “Verdi wrote Falstaff and Otello after he was 70,” and Steve said, “I hate Verdi.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class="clay-paragraph_prologue text-centered" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2o1iu005e3b6xf1cp982q@published data-word-count=9><strong>AFTER THE FINAL reading, work on the show continued.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2o1ka005f3b6x4efs7yr7@published data-word-count=145><strong>DI:</strong> I was still talking to Steve pretty much every other day. Of course, he had a million things to say about what he had heard in the room. We were going to continue working on it. A lot of the talk with Steve was about the shape of the show. It’s not surprising since part of what makes Sondheim shows great is the shape of them, the form, the way dialogue falls naturally into song and the way songs give way to book. Some of our conversations had to do with how the songs he’d written fit in. Was the lead-in right? Where does the button fall, should the song even get a button, or should we hold off applause for a better moment? Everything has to feel inevitable. That’s where Steve’s eye went, to the big and small things that made for inevitability.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2o1na005g3b6xldujfsfw@published data-word-count=8><strong>FR:</strong> What was the process after Steve died?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllr2o1p2005h3b6xxzjh6j8e@published data-word-count=91><strong>DI:</strong> Joe and I cut and moved and reshaped the interlude book material into what is in the show we’re putting up. But we never touched Steve’s work. At that final reading in September ’21 we had proposed a two-line cut in one of his lyrics and he was fine with that. He could see it strengthened what he’d already written. Otherwise, in the show you have the music and lyrics as he wrote them.

If I had to describe this process of eight years on this show, it was fun. Even when he wasn’t writing. It was always fun with Steve. He loved to have fun. I never thought about this being his last show. I’ve been doing this for a long time. My first professional show was 51 years ago. So this was part of a continuum. I had six shows in ten years at Classic Stage. I had all of this other theater life going on, and Steve was in the mix of that. And it was never a duty. It was never homework. It was fun up through that last reading. He loved things that were new and he loved to be surprised.
